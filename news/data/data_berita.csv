Ghana captain Andre Ayew sides with Asamoah Gyan on Suarez incident at 2010 World Cup,"Ghana skipper Andre Ayew says he could have acted in a similar manner as Luis Suarez when the Uruguay striker kept out a goal-bound header with his hands to deny the Black Stars a spot in the semi-final at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. His comments follow similar remarks by legendary Ghana forward Asamoah Gyan, who was at the heart of events as Ghana bowed out of the global showpiece in the quarter-final fixture in Johannesburg.  Talks about the famous incident have been revived after the two nations have been pitted together in the same group for the 2022 World Cup later in Qatar this year. “Like I said before in the past, maybe if it was me or someone else, I could have done the same action [as Suarez],” Al-Sadd winger Ayew told Joy Sports.  “It’s true he killed us, he killed our dream, he killed Africans’ dream, and we all have that feeling that he didn’t make us the first [African] country to get to the semi-finals, so that will always be there. “But he did it for his nation, he took a decision but we don’t [have to] look at that. We want to play well and try and succeed [in Qatar].” In the clash at Soccer City Stadium, Ghana found a last-gasp opportunity to score the winner in extra time when Dominic Adiyiah headed on target, but Suarez produced a goal-line clearance with his hands, copping a red card and winning Ghana a penalty, which Gyan spurned.  In the ensuing penalty shoot-out, there was even more heartbreak for Ghana as they lost on a 4-2 score, making former Liverpool man Suarez a national hero back home. Ex-Sunderland striker Gyan spoke on the incident on Monday, saying: “I remember a game between Sunderland and Liverpool [when I was playing in the Premier League]. We were playing at home on that day and all players were shaking hands.  “I wanted to hit him [Suarez] because people had said things that stuck in my mind. “I was naïve at that time but when I thought about it later, I realized that I had to let it go because I would have done the same thing if I was in his position.” Ghana and Uruguay will lock horns on December 2 in what will be their first meeting after the 2010 incident.

Arsenal star Saka becomes latest footballer to appear on GQ cover,"Arsenal star Bukayo Saka has become the latest footballer to grace the cover of GQ Style, with the 20-year-old winger discussing food, fashion and music alongside his rise to prominence and the best opponent he has faced. A home-grown product of the Gunners’ academy has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence, with remarkable progress allowing him to make more than 120 appearances at club level while also earning 14 senior caps for England. He is now following in the footsteps of David Beckham and Mohamed Salah by adorning the front page of the men’s style magazine. Saka, who made his competitive debut for Arsenal in November 2018 and England bow in September 2020, told GQ Style: “Our coach would always say – even when we were young – he would look at the group and say, ‘only one or two of you is going to make it,’. “We would all look at each other because we were all so good, we were unbeaten, and everyone was baffled, like, who’s it going to be?” Bukayo Saka. Arsenal's starboy 🌟 pic.twitter.com/lPtUDNJdeA After defying the odds to become a professional superstar, Saka now finds himself lining up against some of the best players on the planet. He has locked horns with many all-time greats, but considers a World Cup winner at Barcelona to be the finest he has faced. Saka said: “Sergio Busquets, the way he just so elegantly turned me! [in a pre-season friendly in August 2019]. “I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite.” While holding his own among the global elite, Saka has scored 21 goals for Arsenal and four for his country. He boasts some spectacular strikes within that collection, but considers an iconic effort from seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi to be the greatest he has ever seen. Saka said: “I think I would say Leo Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Club. The one where he dribbled everyone. Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal.”",Football,Exclusive,False,40348,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltcb8a032bae0ca3d3/goal---web-two-way-split--12326361-add3-4419-9451-ed8ccc3acf4a.png?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Barcelona 'on the right track' to register new transfers says Liga chief Tebas,"From Robert Lewandowski to Raphinha, Barcelona have conducted an eye-catching summer of spending - a surprising splurge given the club's well-documented financial concerns. Also causing concern is La Liga's stringent rules on player registration, leaving many to wonder how new boys including Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie and more will be able to play for Barca in 2022-23. However Liga chief Javier Tebas says he has been assured Barca will sort both their financial and registration concerns out to have their new players available - although whether this will be before their opening Liga game against Rayo Vallecano on August 13 remains to be seen. Tebas told Sport: ""They know what they have to do. I think that they still have a bit of work to do but they are on the right track. “Ask FC Barcelona. I can say that they know the rules well and they are well aware of what they have to do. They still need to do it, but there is still some time.” When pressed for details as to how Barca will be able to register so many expensive new signings while meeting Liga's strict salary caps, Tebas said creative sales of their broadcast rights had played a part. “They have sold 10 per cent of their TV rights for €207m. Then they increased that share to 25% which I think gives them some €350m more,"" he said. ""That would be €500m and I think they have another, third lever that of around €200m. With that and if they manage to get some players to leave, this explains the possibility of these signings. “They have been able to sell assets, which was something they needed to do, and to reduce salaries – that’s what allows them to sign.” The biggest signings have been Raphinha from Leeds for around €58 million, and Lewandowski from Bayern for a reported €45m. Christensen and Kessie have also arrived on free transfers from Chelsea and Milan respectively. Barca's spending is not expected to stop there, with a deal for Sevilla defender Jules Kounde imminent and a move for Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta also touted.",Football,Exclusive,False,140,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt27037a8854f6911d/Ballon%20d_Or%20Power%20Rankings_2_1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&quality=50
Does Haaland's signing hint at Guardiola changing Man City's philosophy?,"On the face of it, Pep Guardiola and Erling Haaland are not a natural fit. One is razor-edged with an almost binary understanding of football: score goals in the quickest and most straight-lined way possible. The other is a man of detail and nuance on a scale the sport has arguably never seen before; a tactician who demands the ball is moved around in meticulous patterns long before thoughts turn to sticking it in the net. On a basic level, Haaland is a man of attacking transitions and penalty-box poaching with a relatively limited ability outside traditional centre-forward areas, while Guardiola demands the exact opposite of his number nines. But that is only one reading. Deeper tactical analysis suggests that Haaland can adapt to Guardiola and Guardiola can adapt to Haaland. The two ideas can fuse to make both player and club more lethal. The critique that Haaland does not fit the false-nine stylings of City through 2021-22 is redundant. Guardiola never wanted to be playing like this (hence his long pursuit of Harry Kane last summer) and with good reason. Manchester City can be guilty of playing too slowly, particularly when faced with a stubborn defensive blockade. With a false nine adding yet more bodies into central attacking midfield,, they have been playing too much in front of the opposition, particularly in matches where they have dropped points against Southampton, Crystal Palace and Tottenham. They need someone like Haaland to make hyper-intelligent movements in the penalty area. These will be useful when the box is crowded and City are 25 yards from goal; after a high turnover when the opponent is briefly stretched; and when City finally work the ball behind the defence at a tight angle, ready to find a cut back. In other words, City often have too many players doing the same thing in the No.10 space, and it is noteworthy that Sergio Aguero was able to excel under Guardiola despite never fully learning how to link the play or press aggressively. There are more than enough City players swarming the opponent to allow Haaland to drift in and out a little. Since Leroy Sane’s departure, City have badly missed his capacity to break in behind a deep defence, and in Haaland they have signed the world’s best player at timing those kinds of runs. What’s more, that movement – likely to lead to many tap-ins at the end of long City passing chains – will draw defences out of their compressed shape, helping others get into creative positions. It is equally important to remember that, despite popular belief, Guardiola is not a dogmatic coach with one specific way of playing. His Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Man City teams have played in subtly different ways to each other, as Guardiola adapts his strategy to the demands of the country’s league and to the style of player at his disposal. Famously in his first few months as Bayern manager, Guardiola chastised his players for playing lots of short passes to each other. They had assumed that was what their manager wanted. Instead, he told them to play like Bayern; like a German team. To take a more recent example, there is nothing about the way Kevin De Bruyne plays – driving forward, angling risky passes into the penalty area, shooting from range – that conforms to the supposed Guardiolaisms. This is because while Guardiola has very specific ideas about positional play and where to pass, this is only the case up until the final third - when players are then given the freedom to improvise and work out their own patterns. Consequently, City will adapt to Haaland. The creative players in the team will love seeing those runs and will feed Haaland the ball as often as they can. They will work the ball in new ways because, at last, they will have the option to release someone through on goal. De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva in particular will shift City’s playing style just enough to accomodate the 21-year-old. But Haaland, of course, will have to meet them half way. He has been steadily improving his game outside the box over the last few years, recording better numbers in terms of passing, linking the play, and pressing from the front. And yet on most of these measures, he still ranks poorly against other strikers. FBRef’s report comparing Haaland to all forwards in the ‘Big Five’ leagues over the last 365 days (across all competitions) has him in the 44th percentile for passes completed; the 38th percentile for short passes completed; the 24th percentile for pressures; and the 36th percentile for touches. Haaland, though, will not need to become as adept as Phil Foden in deeper areas to work in a Guardiola team. A lot of the high turnovers Man City achieve from their hard pressing, for example, can be done by others – to then release Haaland in behind. But he does need to do a lot better than he has been doing over the last two years, even accounting for the different tactical demands at Borussia Dortmund. Guardiola clearly anticipates that a young and intelligent player like Haaland has the capacity to adapt his game and learn the ropes. Most likely, the Norway international will do just that, and yet it is curious to note Guardiola has recently developed a habit of chasing star players who do not instinctively fit his philosophy. First it was Jack Grealish, then a late attempt to sign Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of August, and now City have signed Haaland shortly after their interest in Paul Pogba was recently made public. It begs the question: does Guardiola want players like Haaland to adapt to his methods, or is there a whole new Guardiola methodology on the horizon?",Football,Rumor,False,32061,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt14dd1e85f6bef8e5/GOAL_-_Multiple_Images_-_3_Stacked_-_Facebook_-_2023-11-27T113434.317.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Juventus CEO confirms Vlahovic transfer affected Dybala extension talks as Argentine set to leave,"Dusan Vlahovic's arrival at Juventus has played a key role in the club's decision against renewing Paulo Dybala's contract, says CEO Maurizio Arrivabene. The Argentina international had been in talks with the Serie A side over a new deal, but will instead depart the club for free at the end of the season. The January signing of Vlahovic from Fiorentina has changed the club's plans for the coming years, Arrivabene said, resulting in the decision to let Dybala's contract expire. He told reporters: ""It was a friendly, clear and respectful meeting. We had a very sincere approach.  ""With the arrival of Vlahovic, Paulo was no longer at the centre of the project and we made this decision.  ""The arrival of Dusan changed the position. The technical structure of the team and the Juventus project has undergone some changes.  ""Part of these changes concern Dybala's contract, which has not been renewed."" Juventus previously offered Dybala a contract in October and were set to reduce the salary they were willing to pay him even further before deciding not to renew his deal. ""It would not have been easy for Juventus to make a lower offer,"" he said.  ""Paulo spent seven years of his career with us, an offer of that kind would not have shown the respect that there is towards him. No one has ever questioned Dybala's technical prowess.  ""The parameters in October were different. There were considerations to be made on attendance, on the length of the contract and others of an economic nature.  ""It is important to underline that the management does not take decisions against Juventus, but in favor of the club."" Dybala, 28, joined Juventus from Palermo in 2015 and has won five Serie A titles and the Coppa Italia four times with the club. He has made 283 appearances overall, scoring 113 times. This season, he has played 29 times in all competitions and scored 13 goals.",Football,Analysis,False,8282,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt02cb27e38bef34f7/GOAL_-_Blank_WEB_-_Facebook_-_2023-09-17T154922.062.jpg
Chelsea make contact with Man City over Sterling transfer,"Chelsea are preparing a move for Raheem Sterling after making contact with Manchester City over the forward, GOAL understands.  Thomas Tuchel is understood to want the England international with striker Romelu Lukaku set to rejoin Inter on loan with doubts remaining over the futures of Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic.  No formal bid has yet been made for the 27-year-old, who has 12 months remaining on his current City contract, but he is likely to cost more than the £45 million ($55m) Arsenal are set to pay for Gabriel Jesus.  The England international has yet to say publicly whether he would be open to a move although he is understood to want more game time after slipping down the pecking order at City.  Sterling played more minutes as an attacker than any other City forward last season but competition will increase with the arrival of Erling Haaland, although Jesus will complete his move to the Gunners soon.  He was left out of the starting line-up for a number of big games last season, including both Champions League semi-final legs against Real Madrid and the final day victory over Aston Villa.  Sterling has revealed in the past a desire to play abroad at some point in his career and Real Madrid and Barcelona have shown interest in him before.  After the disastrous spell of club record signing Lukaku, Chelsea are looking at refreshing their squad.  Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen have already left with several big names expected to follow.  Sterling would be Chelsea's first major signing since they were taken over by a consortium led by Todd Boehly in May.  He will lead any negotiations after being confirmed as Chelsea's interim sporting director following the departure of Marina Granovskaia.",Football,Rumor,False,43855,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltfb6f38cc4b3f244c/crop/MM5DQMZSHI2DMOB2NZXXOZJ2GA5DCNBU/edbf74cc-d9bf-4d9b-95dc-895d79202da4.png

Premier League 'don't think' Abramovich can sell Chelsea if he is sanctioned,"Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has admitted that he doesn't think Roman Abramovich can sell Chelsea if he is sanctioned as Russia's military conflict with Ukraine continues. Chelsea are currently preparing for the departure of Abramovich after 19 years under the Russian billionaire's ownership as he has put the club up for sale for £2.6 billion ($3.5bn). Abramovich said he has taken the decision with the ""club’s best interest at heart"" amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, but the Premier League have warned that he may well need to secure a quick sale. Speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit, Premier League chief Masters said of Abramovich's impending departure: “I think the situation has escalated incredibly quickly over the last seven days and he’s come to the right conclusion.  “It’s unsustainable in the current environment. It’s a welcome decision and obviously, for the sake of everybody, including the fans, as soon as the sale process concludes everyone has certainty.”  British MPs have called for tougher sanctions against Russian oligarchs such as Abramovich, and Masters harbours doubts over whether the sale of Chelsea will ultimately go through. Asked what would happen if Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, the top-flight executive told his audience in London: “I don’t think that will work. I think the quickest (sale) we have ever done is 10 days, that’s not to say that record can’t be beaten but normally it takes a number of weeks.  “It all depends on the complexity of the deal and the number of potential owners. Provided the information is easily digestible, easily understandable and gives us all the right answers it can be done relatively quickly.” Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly is thought to be in pole postion to buy Chelsea. Boehly is interested in purchasing the club behind a consortium with Swiss mogul Hansjorg Wyss, but no formal bids have been submitted as of yet. Indeed, GOAL can confirm that a number of parties have already ruled themselves out of the running, with Marina Granovskaia and the rest of the current Chelsea directors set to stay on for the foreseeable future. Whoever comes in as the new owner will eventually decide their fate, but in light of the sale announcement, Abramovich's original plans to hand over ""stewardship"" of the club to trustees have been scrapped.",Football,Match,False,8326,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/getty-2241688174/crop/MM5DINJQGA5DENJTGE5G433XMU5DAORSGM2A====/GettyImages-2241688174.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60

The footage began circulating on social media early on Sunday morning, hours after Manchester City's 3-2 defeat against Tottenham. Foden, who played the full 90 minutes at Etihad Stadium, appears to be out in Manchester with his family and friends when they were subjected to an unprovoked attack by a group of men.

Both teams to score weekend accumulator,"Valencia have scored in their last 19 home league games but have conceded in five of their last six. Elche, meanwhile, have scored in eight of their last 10 competitive games and there should be plenty of interest in backing goals and both ends of this regional derby, particularly at the healthy-looking price quoted. Two of the top scoring teams in Serie A meet this weekend and goals at both ends look guaranteed. Both teams to score has paid out in eight of Verona's last nine league clashes, while proving profitable in 10 of Atalanta's last 12 games in the Italian top flight. Indeed, Gianpiero Gasperini's men have netted in 37 of the 41 league matches they have played in 2021 and can almost always be relied upon to be involved in high-scoring encounters. The visitors have been one of the most consistent scorers in the Premier League and have netted in 10 of their last 11 games, including against both Manchester clubs as well as Tottenham and West Ham. Liverpool, meanwhile, have conceded in five of their last 10 top-flight games, while scoring in 25 successive games and the price offered for goals at both ends at Anfield offers value. The visitors are one of the most in-form sides in the Bundesliga with five wins from their last six matches, while Freiburg have been one of the most consistent scorers in the division netting in 11 of their 14 clashes.

"What could possibly go wrong?! Semi-automated VAR to make offside calls at 2022 World Cup, FIFA confirms","FIFA has announced semi-automated, state-of-the-art technology will be used at the 2022 World Cup to help aid tight offside decisions and speed up the use of VAR. Qatar 2022 will see technology play a more prominent role than ever, with a new system being trialled at the Arab Cup and Club World Cup in 2021. It is suggested that the process of making a definitive offside call will be cut from around 70 seconds to just 25. A sensor in the middle of the official World Cup match ball, which sends data 500 times a second to determine an exact point of contact, will be used alongside 12 dedicated multi-tracking cameras mounted to the roof of each stadium. Those cameras track both the position of the ball and 29 separate points on each player, with data sent 50 times per second in order to calculate where each individual is on the pitch. If someone strays into an offside position, the video assistant referee will be alerted and they can then relay a message to the on-field officials, with FIFA claiming that this process “happens within a few seconds and means that offside decisions can be made faster and more accurately”. Once an offside call has been flagged, a 3D animation will be generated “which will always show the best possible perspectives for an offside situation”, with those graphics being displayed on big screens inside any given venue. More tests are planned ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which is due to get underway on November 21, but FIFA are convinced that the new technology is fit for purpose and ready to be rolled out. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said: “At the FIFA World Cup in 2018, FIFA took the brave step to use VAR technology on the world’s biggest stage, and it has proven to be an undisputable success. “Semi-automated offside technology is an evolution of the VAR systems that have been implemented across the world. “This technology is the culmination of three years of dedicated research and testing to provide the very best for the teams, players and fans who will be heading to Qatar later this year, and FIFA is proud of this work, as we look forward to the world seeing the benefits of semi-automated offside technology at the 2022 World Cup. “FIFA is committed to harnessing technology to improve the game of football at all levels, and the use of semi-automated offside technology at the FIFA World Cup in 2022 is the clearest possible evidence.”",Football,Exclusive,False,44210,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltbec8a1a22911b973/Guiu%20Estevao%20George%20Chelsea%20GFX.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60

Mourinho was happy with the way his side dominated the Serie A encounter and joked that they did not want viewers at home to turn the game off by going further ahead. “Yes we could’ve controlled the game better, but this is still a big achievement,” he told DAZN. “It’s not easy to win 4-2 here.” “Coming into this game we already knew that Lazio, Atalanta, and Fiorentina all dropped points, so it was important for us to win and we did it.” “As for the second half, we did it for the audience. They would’ve turned their TV’s off it we went up 5-0. The victory is Roma's third in a row in all competitions and takes them up to sixth in the Serie A table. Their next game is on February 6 at home against Genoa, who are second bottom of the league, followed by a headline Coppa Italia clash against Inter.",Football,Exclusive,False,11261,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltd77a1cb3aae2f36b/GOAL%20-%20Blank%20WEB%20-%20Facebook%20-%202025-10-17T071153.418.png?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
CAF demands investigation into Napoli chief De Laurentiis after 'irresponsible' Afcon remarks,"The Confederation of African Football (CAF) says it is ""appalled"" by recent comments made by Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis. In a statement, the governing body called on UEFA to take action against the executive for his ""irresponsible"" remarks. De Laurentiis sparked outrage when he claimed last week that he would not sign any more African players unless they agreed to miss the Africa Cup of Nations. Napoli were without Kalidou Koulibaly - now at Chelsea - and Andre Zambo Anguissa for a handful of matches last season as the pair competed at Afcon for Senegal and Cameroon, respectively. The Serie A club's owner told Wall Street Italia: ""I told them, lads, don't talk to me about Africans anymore! ""I love them, but either they sign something confirming they'll back out of playing the Africa Cup of Nations, or otherwise between that tournament, the World Cup qualifiers in South America, these players are never available! ""We are the idiots who pay salaries only to send them all over the world playing for others."" CAF's statement in response to the Napoli president's comments read: ""CAF is appalled by the irresponsible and unacceptable remarks made by Napoli President, Mr Aurelio De Laurentiis on African players and the Africa Cup of Nations. ""By publicly declaring that players who sign for Napoli must sign a waiver denouncing participation in the Africa Cup of Nations as a condition of employment, De Laurentiis' comments [are] likely to fall under Article 14 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulation. CAF therefore urges UEFA to initiate disciplinary investigation against him."" The statement continued on to question whether De Laurentiis would take the same view of players from other continents such as South America or Asia.  CAF will now await a response from UEFA who it believes should find the Napoli chief in violation of its disciplinary rules.",Football,Rumor,False,16498,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt0a14c1be9090124c/Calvin%20Verdonk.jpg?width=1400&upscale=true
Liverpool seeking £5m Carvalho deal with Fulham as Bournemouth make loan bid for Williams,"Liverpool are looking to strike a £5million ($6.7m) deal with Fulham for the signing of teenage star Fabio Carvalho. The Reds have made an official approach for the 19-year-old, and are willing to allow him to remain with the Championship promotion-chasers until the summer in order to beat competition from a host of rival clubs. Further talks will take place on Monday, with acceptance at Liverpool that there is plenty of work to do in order to complete the signing before the 11pm GMT transfer deadline. Having secured the signing of Luis Diaz from Porto in a deal worth £50m ($67m) on Sunday, Liverpool are looking to add to their attacking options by bringing in the exciting England U18 international. Carvalho has been one of the stars of Fulham’s promotion push this season, scoring seven times for Marco Silva’s side having made his Premier League debut under Scott Parker last term. He is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham would be resigned to losing him for only a minor compensation fee, particularly if he were to join a foreign club. Liverpool hope to take advantage of that by paying a £5m ($6.7m) fee now. The Reds signed another gifted youngster, Harvey Elliott, from Fulham in 2019. While that deal was somewhat acrimonious, ending in a lengthy tribunal, relations were soothed when the Cottagers signed Welsh international Harry Wilson last summer. It is understood that a host of other clubs are keen on Carvalho, including Chelsea, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. It is likely that there will be at least one player leaving the Reds on deadline day. Liverpool have received a loan offer from Bournemouth for full-back Neco Williams, and are likely to accept. The 20-year-old is keen to play regular first-team football, and with Joe Gomez, James Milner and the up-and-coming Conor Bradley all able to play right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold is unavailable or in need of a rest, Liverpool feel they are able to loan Williams out. Offers may well arrive for Takumi Minamino, Divock Origi and Nat Phillips too, although GOAL understands Minamino is desperate to remain at Anfield until the end of the season. Initial approaches from both Leeds and Monaco have been rejected. Phillips meanwhile faces another uncertain deadline day, with interest from Brighton, Watford, Newcastle and Burnley all dependent on what happens elsewhere - Newcastle’s bid for Dan Burn, for example.",Football,Analysis,False,25620,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt20eb075dcb22be02/GOAL%20-%20Multiple%20Images%20-%202%20Split%20-%20Facebook%20(2).jpg?width=1400&upscale=true
'I didn't touch the ball for 25 minutes!' - Haaland admits Man City are a 'different level' to Dortmund as he recalls Champions League struggles,"New Manchester City signing Erling Haaland acknowledges that he will have to step up his game at the Premier League champions, who gave the forward a torrid evening the last time they met.  Haaland arrives at the Etihad Stadium as one of the world's elite goalscorers after two and a half incredible seasons with Dortmund.  But he is aware that record will count for little unless he can shine alongside his illustrious new team-mates. ""It is a big challenge, it is a new country, a new league, new coach, new everything so it is a big challenge but I know how it is to come to a new club, I have done it a couple of times before. I am really looking forward to it,"" the Norwegian told reporters at Sunday's press conference. ""I played against them in the Champions League last year and you see something on TV and then when you meet it is completely different. ""I didn’t touch the ball for 25 minutes and it is like, [Ilkay] Gundogan, please stop playing tiki-taka! ""It is a different level how they play and that is what I want to be a part of. ""What am I looking to improve? Everything, headers, shooting, left foot, right foot, movement, with the ball, off the ball."" While still just 21, Haaland has become a superstar thanks to his prodigious ability in front of the net.  He made his senior debut for second-tier Norwegian side Bryne aged just 15 and swiftly earned a move to Molde, from where he was snapped up by Red Bull Salzburg in January 2019, still six months short of his 19th birthday.  The goals kept coming in Austria too, and after less than a year at Red Bull and 29 strikes in 27 games, Dortmund won the race for his signature, taking him to the Bundesliga in 2020.  That step up in quality did not slow Haaland's amazing strike-rate, netting 86 in 89 outings during his time with BVB; and City will hope he can adapt just as seamlessly to his new surroundings after spending £51 million ($63m) to bring him to the Premer League.",Football,Analysis,False,44841,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt23663b093326d592/crop/MM5DCMRYGA5DOMRQHJXG653FHIYTMMR2GE2Q====/06.gif?width=1400&upscale=true

Fans in excess of 60,000 were at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium to witness the two regional rivals battle for a coveted ticket to play in the global competition. Lookman made his debut for the Super Eagles in the 74th minute when he came in for Moses Simon. Despite playing for about 20 minutes only, the Leicester City attacker was delighted and went on to express his feelings for playing in such a high magnitude game.

Playing in Africa is a lot more physical, it’s just adjusting to the environment, the pitch, the weather, it’s harder to breathe so it’s just adjusting to it."" ""The reception has been amazing.

De Bruyne's Haaland impression moves Man City one step closer to Premier League title,"Match Statistics: Wolves 1-5 Manchester City Arms outstretched and finger curled in a zen pose, Kevin De Bruyne celebration was an attempt to imitate Manchester City's summer signing Erling Haaland. It wasn't his best impression of the Norwegian international in Wednesday night's 5-1 win at Wolves. That came in the preceding 24 minutes when he smashed an incredible hat-trick that moved Pep Guardiola's side to within four points of a fourth Premier League title in five years. There was even time for a fourth and a goal for Raheem Sterling to boost City's goal difference and eke out every advantage they could in the title race. The thought of Haaland and De Bruyne together must be terrifying the rest of the Premier League after the club confirmed the 21-year-old striker will join from Borussia Dortmund. City will be pairing the deadliest young striker in Europe with probably the most brilliantly creative attacking midfielder of the past five years. But we will have to wait a little bit longer for that. For now, De Bruyne decided to take on both roles with an astonishing performance in a potentially dangerous visit to Wolves, where any slip-up would have given Liverpool encouragement for the final 10 days of the season. It only took Kevin De Bruyne 24 minutes to score a hat-trick 🤯 pic.twitter.com/QUWzR3Lsm5 Power, precision and remarkable finishing, this was exactly the sort of performance they will hope to get from Haaland when he joins up with the club next season. Of course, De Bruyne's incredible passing game was still there, as the Belgian picked out a delicious pass for Phil Foden inside the opening few minutes that drifted just wide. But then he decided to do the damage himself with the third fastest hat-trick in Premier League history – and few even over 90 minutes will have had as much quality. The first inside seven minutes was a driving run into the box followed by a fierce clinical shot across goalkeeper Jose Sa. Then, De Bruyne's first-time pass picked out Sterling nine minutes later, and when the ball rebounded off the keeper, he smashed in a second. His third was just a brutal clubbing shot from the edge of the box that powered past Sa before he could properly react. De Bruyne tested out his borrowed goal celebration in front of the delighted away fans – Foden just smiled and shook his head in disbelief as he patted his team-mate after a stunning contribution. Kevin De Bruyne is inevitable 😤 pic.twitter.com/3RmmSNCScN With a defensive crisis pressing 37-year-old midfielder Fernandinho into an emergency centre-back role, City's best route to victory was always attacking. Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte had got into a mess in the 11th minute that had led to Leander Dendoncker snatching an equaliser. But the punishing performance from De Bruyne took all the pressure off. Just seven days ago in the heartbreak of the Champions League defeat to Real Madrid, many were questioning the 30-year-old. It was an admittedly disappointing and off-night but he, along with City have given the perfect response. Guardiola's side are now three points clear in a week when they've made a signing that many regard as potentially the most iconic in the club's history – beating Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich to Haaland's signature. Ironically, when De Bruyne signed from the Bundesliga in 2015 it wasn't viewed in quite the same way.  One English newspaper described him as 'The £60m Reject' after his tough early years at Chelsea. City would be more than happy if Haaland can get close to De Bruyne's impact.",Football,Update,False,15110,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt1e98a6c7b3f2a067/Transfer_gurus_Liverpool.jpg
"Man Utd are one of the best teams in the world right now, says Atletico Madrid boss Simeone","Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has insisted that Manchester United are ""one of the best teams in the world"" right now ahead of their last-16 Champions League tie. United will arrive at Wanda Metropolitano for the first leg on Wednesday night on the back of a confidence-boosting 4-2 victory at Leeds. That result saw Ralf Rangnick's side tighten their grip on fourth place in the Premier League, and Simeone is expecting a tough test for his team in front of their own fans. The Red Devils struggled for consistency in the first half of the season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but Simeone is wary of how far they have come in a short space of time under Rangnick. ""We're facing one of the best teams in the world in the last 14 games, if I'm not mistaken,"" the Argentine told a pre-match press conference. ""They've just lost one. With the new manager, Ralf Rangnick, it's given the team solidity, teamwork, commitment. ""We can see what Manchester United was always like. They've evolved since the new manager arrived, they're already fourth in the league. ""It's an intense, dynamic team, very brave, with very good forwards, very good footballers overall and who try to make a huge effort to try and unite the huge talents they have in 11 players. ""It's going to be a very difficult game, as every Champions League game is. But we have a lot of anticipation to play in our stadium in front of our fans and we're lucky to play the last 16 at home because we couldn't play that, we couldn't do that last year."" The Red Devils have played a total of 15 games across all competitions under Rangnick to date, posting eight wins, five draws and just two losses. A 1-0 home defeat to Wolves and a penalty shootout loss to Middlesbrough in the fourth round of the FA Cup are the only black marks on the interim manager's record so far, with United now looking a more solid, well-rounded outfit. Simeone has been impressed by the changes Rangnick has managed to implement, but he will have his own plan ready to try and breach their stubborn rearguard in the Spanish capital. ""The team is much more compact, it's stronger,"" the Atletico chief added. ""They have a solidity at the back, they're a very physical team with the central defenders and the midfield they've got. ""They are really strong and it's really, really difficult to find vulnerabilities there. I always assess the virtues of our rival, but of course, we will try to find a way to try and hurt them, try and find our way to the goal, if you like.""",Football,Rumor,False,21900,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt18eedc48bb293dcd/crop/MM5DCMZZGI5DOOBTHJXG653FHIZDINR2GEYA====/GOAL%20-%20Blank%20WEB%20-%20Facebook(21).jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
'I was sh*tting myself!' - Pedri on nutmeg that still has Barcelona buzzing,"Barcelona wonderkid Pedri admitted that he was scared he would end up looking like a fool even as he pulled off a remarkable nutmeg during his team's thrashing of Athletic Club on Sunday.  The 19-year-old left Mikel Balenziaga standing with an exquisite piece of skill at Camp Nou as Barca raced to a 4-0 win.  It was reminiscent of one Juan Roman Riquelme, who humiliated Colombia hardman Mario Yepes with an almost identical trick when the then-Boca Juniors and River Plate stars found themselves on opposing sides of the 2000 Superclasico in Argentina.  ""On a personal level I'm feeling really good, I enjoy having the ball at my feet,"" the youngster told Movistar after the game.  ""With the nutmeg I was sh*tting myself that it wouldn't work, but it came off!""

"Huddersfield vs Stoke: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Huddersfield are looking to strengthen their hold on a promotion play-off place when they take on Stoke in the Championship on Friday. The home side are sixth in the English second tier and on a nine-game winning run heading into the clash with Michael O'Neill’s side, who are still in contention for a play-off place. Huddersfield are slight favourites for this tie, available at 31/20 (2.55) with bet365 to win this contest. Stoke, who have lost their last two matches in the league, are 9/5 (2.8) to get the three points. The two teams sharing the points on Friday night is available at 9/4 (3.25). Huddersfield striker Jordan Rhodes is available at 6/1 (7.0) to score the first goal of the game. Sam Surridge of Stoke can be backed at 13/2 (7.5) to break the deadlock. Stoke have a fantastic record against Friday's opponents, having won five and drawn two of the eight matches they have played in just over four years.  It is Huddersfield, however, who are in the best shape heading into Friday evening's encounter. Their eight-game unbeaten run in the Championship turned them into strong contenders to reach the play-offs. Stoke, on the other hand, have plummeted down the table with just one win from six Championship games.  Both sides have some injury troubles to contend with.  For the hosts, on-loan centre-back Levi Colwill and Ryan Schofield are unavailable, as are longer-term absentees Rolando Aarons and Alex Vallejo.  Stoke goalkeeper Josef Bursik is still out, while Harry Souttar and Romaine Sawyers are also missing through injury. Nick Powell, Joe Allen and Tyrese Campbell could return to the side, however.  Given the difference in form between these two teams and Huddersfield's penchant for finding the net in recent weeks, odds of 6/5 (2.2) for there being more than 2.5 goals in this game look like good value.

Ziyech: Morocco open door for Chelsea winger to return to squad,"Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has confirmed the door for the national team is wide open for Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech ahead of the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. The 29-year-old has on two occasions turned down a call to feature for the Atlas Lions, the latest coming in the 2022 World Cup play-offs against the Democratic Republic of Congo a month ago. Despite earning a call to join the provisional squad named by coach Vahid Halilhodzic, the Chelsea player alongside Ajax defender Noussair Mazraoui turned it down saying he was concentrating on club duties.

The South Korea international has formed a formidable strike partnership with team-mate Harry Kane, and is one of the most important members of the Tottenham team. You might be familiar with the camera celebration Son does right after he scores a goal - but what is the significance of it? GOAL takes a look. After Son hits the ball into the net, he often celebrates in the direction of the camera, shaping his fingers into the motion of pretending to take a picture with a camera. Paired with his signature grin, it is a trademark celebration of the Tottenham forward. Son explained his reasoning behind the celebration in an interview with Sky Sports, and the meaning behind his special camera celebration is incredibly wholesome. ""Maybe a year ago, I was thinking about what could be a special celebration,"" Son said. A HAT-TRICK WORTHY OF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOOTBALL ⭐️⭐️⭐️ pic.twitter.com/zQANxX6vZc ""And then I tried to find one. The camera celebration is because if I score a goal, it's a good memory.

Son, who joined Spurs in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen, is well past a century of goals for the club and has impressed under a succession of managers in north London.

His absence was always going to be felt at Villa Park, despite much of the fee he generated being reinvested on new recruits, and Martinez admits his side have struggled for consistency after losing a key creative influence and on-field leader. After helping Villa secure promotion back into the Premier League in 2019, Grealish registered 17 goals and 18 assists across two seasons. With those qualities now aiding the cause of reigning English champions, Martinez said: “He was the best player we had. He was outstanding last season but we understood he needed to make that step. The signings we made were really positive but they needed time to adapt. “You can see now at the end of the season the inconsistency as well because we have a new manager, a new philosophy. Next season, we will know what to do. “It has been difficult inside (the club) but we have been very positive and we have double figures in clean sheets now.” Jack Grealish's transformation at Aston Villa was crazy 💪 pic.twitter.com/3CM09PuUfa Martinez added: “Obviously there has been investment at the club and everyone expected us to be top eight or top seven but it is difficult when there are so many changes in one season. We have been inconsistent but we have to realise we sold Jack, a home-grown player and the best we had at Villa. “We have had to rebuild and find new players but they need time to adapt. We changed the manager in mid-season too, with a new philosophy. It isn’t as easy as it looks.” A big-money move to City has not played out entirely as planned for Grealish, as he has just five goals and three assists this season. Villa meanwhile have toiled at times without him and find themselves languishing closer to a relegation battle than a bid for European qualification. With six games left, Gerrard’s side sit 15th in the Premier League, eight points clear of the drop zone.",Football,Rumor,False,48060,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt0d52ef8356e447e7/Dean%20James.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
'It's in Man City's hands' - Henderson admits Liverpool are playing catch-up in Premier League title race,"Jordan Henderson has admitted the Premier League title is in Manchester City's hands and Liverpool are playing catch-up after failing to beat the champions at Etihad Stadium. City and Liverpool played out a thrilling 2-2 draw on Sunday that ensured Pep Guardiola's side remain one point clear of the Reds at the top of the table with seven matches remaining. Jurgen Klopp's men twice came from behind to earn a point in Manchester, but Henderson admitted having ""mixed emotions"" after the final whistle. The Liverpool captain has warned his team-mates they must now be alert to capitalise on any mistakes from Man City in the final weeks of the campaign. ""We wanted to come here and win and then it would have been in our hands in the next seven games,"" Henderson told LFC TV.  ""Unfortunately it's not and it's in City's hands. We have to keep going right to the end and if there's any slip-up we need to be there ready to pounce. That's the mentality. ""Mixed emotions as we wanted three points but we dug deep and didn't lose the game, which is important as well. We have to take the positives and move on and get ready for the next game. ""It's going to be an intense game at this level and magnitude, and it was, especially early on. We could have started a bit better but to be fair I thought we kept going and went behind twice and came back twice, that's really positive and shows great character to keep going in tough moments.  ""At the same time we can be a bit better, especially with the ball. I felt when we played football it hurt them, and that's where the goals came from."" Liverpool's next Premier League outing will see them welcome arch-rivals Manchester United to Anfield on April 19, five days before a Merseyside derby clash with Everton at Goodison Park. The Reds' final game of the month will see them take on Newcastle at St James Park and they are due to open their May schedule with a home encounter against Tottenham. Liverpool's season will conclude with fixtures against Aston Villa, Southampton and Wolves, but they also still have Champions League and FA Cup commitments as a potential quadruple remains in their sights.",Football,Match,False,36222,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUddMnm4xTdRy8b8L0tKlxrctmn95YAn6txA&s
Rangnick: I don't know what Fletcher's role is at Man Utd,"Ralf Rangick has admitted that he doesn't know exactly what role Darren Fletcher has at Old Trafford, but has revealed that he has a big input in what goes on in training. Former United midfielder Fletcher was brought back to the club by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January last year, initially taking up a coaching role with the first-team squad. He was appointed the club's first-ever technical director two months later, and is now working closely with Ralf Rangnick, who replaced Solskjaer as head coach on an interim basis following his sacking in November. Rangnick has found Fletcher's opinion on tactics and intimate knowledge of the United squad valuable during his first three months in charge, but concedes he is still in the dark with regards to the specific nature of his technical director post. ""Well, I can only talk about what I've experienced in the last 11 to 12 weeks. He has always been part of almost every training session and each game,"" the German manager told reporters when quizzed on Fletcher. ""Whenever I have had a question about what he thinks, because he obviously knows the players, he has known them for a long time. I could always, and will always, ask him for his opinion. So it is good to have him in the team. ""What is his role in with regard to the club? I don't really know, to be honest. I can only tell you what is happening in the training sessions, around the training sessions and around the games. In those areas, it is good to have him on board."" Fletcher spent the majority of his 16-year playing career on United's books, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League while making 342 appearances for the club. The 38-year-old set about getting his coaching badges after retiring following a spell at Stoke City in 2019, and since returning to Old Trafford last year he has enjoyed great influence behind the scenes. His role as technical director is officially a boardroom title and linked with recruitment, though, which has led to some confusion given his regular presence in training sessions and at matches. Fletcher temporarily returned to the coaching set-up during Michael Carrick's caretaker stint at the helm before Rangnick's appointment, and was seen in the dugout again for United's 1-1 draw with Southampton on Feburary 12 and their 2-0 win against Brighton last Tuesday.",Football,Match,False,46580,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt74fc3d8e367fd306/Lay%20Off%20Benjamin%20Sesko.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60

One more year? Why Klopp would love 'role model' Milner to stay at Liverpool,"If Fenway Sports Group were paying attention to Liverpool’s win over Newcastle, then James Milner can surely expect a phone call. Age ain’t nothing but a number, and the 36-year-old proved as much at St James’ Park on Saturday, delivering a timeless performance as Jurgen Klopp’s side kept up the pressure on Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. “Outstanding,” was Klopp’s verdict. There’s a reason he wants his vice-captain to stick around for at least another season, and this was it. In the Tyneside heat, Milner did what he always does. He led by example, he got his head down and he produced the goods. It was his tackle, firm but fair on Fabian Schar, which led to the winning goal, scored in superb fashion by Naby Keita. It was his pass, clipped perfectly over the top of the Newcastle defence, which should have led to another for Diogo Jota in the second half.  And when Jonjo Shelvey lined up a dangerous-looking free-kick, 25 yards out, it was his head which deflected the ball to safety. He spent a few seconds on the floor after that, but was soon back on his feet, chasing and challenging, recycling possession and making sure his team-mates didn’t dare switch off.  Liverpool aren’t short of leaders, by any means, but Milner’s standards are the highest of them all. Impress him, and you’re doing something right. Fall short, and you’ll know about it. It is coming up to 20 years since he made his debut as a professional, and his appetite for the game is as strong now as it was when emerging as a teenager with boyhood club Leeds United.  That’s why he - and Liverpool - have a decision to make this summer. Do they stick or twist? One more year or a thanks-for-the-memories? Milner’s contract expires in June, and while there have been initial talks between the club and his representative, Matthew Buck, it is fair to say that there are doubts on both sides at present.  FSG appreciate the superb service he has given the club since joining on a free transfer from Manchester City in 2015. He has made close to 300 appearances, in a range of different positions, and never has he let anybody down. His fingerprints are all over some of Liverpool’s greatest nights, and all of Klopp’s biggest triumphs. “Nothing we achieved over the last few years would have happened without him,” the manager himself suggested at St James’ Park. But time waits for nobody. Milner may be as fit as ever - no player, on either side, recorded a higher average speed during Saturday’s game - but he will be 37 in January and knows he is, at best, Klopp’s fifth-choice midfield option. With the likes of Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott and the soon-to-arrive Fabio Carvalho all developing rapidly, opportunities could be even further limited next season. Saturday was his 35th appearance of the season - he made 36 last term and 37 in 2019-20 - but only his eighth Premier League start, and his first since January 2. He may understand when he’s left out - and Liverpool’s form hardly helps him argue otherwise - but that doesn’t mean he’s happy with it, or that he’s willing to accept it. It is that, rather than salary or length of contract, which will play the biggest part in his decision. Klopp, certainly, would like him to stay and has made that point both to Milner and to Julian Ward, the incoming sporting director. Ward and Milner go way back, having worked together at Manchester City, and the smart money is on an agreement being reached over a one-year extension.  It is interesting to compare and contrast Milner’s situation with that of Fernandinho, another veteran midfielder who is out of contract in the summer. The Manchester City captain appeared to catch his manager, Pep Guardiola, by surprise when announcing in a recent Champions League press conference his intention to return to Brazil. “I didn’t know,” Guardiola responded, adding that “I understand players want to play…I would love to be with him [longer].” Like Milner at Liverpool, Fernandinho is a key figure at City, a standard-bearer in training and a vocal presence in the dressing room. Like Milner, he has deputised in various positions, stepping in and stepping up, and like Milner, he will be hard to replace, if and when he eventually leaves.  Liverpool have found in recent years with the likes of Dejan Lovren, Gini Wijnaldum and, in particular, Adam Lallana, that often it is the person, the character, who is missed as much as the player. Milner most definitely falls into that category. Not many players, after all, have a door named after them at the training ground.  “He sets the standard, in a way not many people can set standards,” said Klopp on Saturday. “He’s a role model, and incredibly important for us.” Newcastle served only to underline that fact. And if the manager gets his wish, Milner’s influence at Anfield will continue for a little while longer.",Football,Rumor,False,11404,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltc66585315b64be22/Miliano%20Jonathans.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Nunez's stupid sending-off leaves Liverpool's title hopes hanging in the balance,"It’s fair to say that’s not how Darwin Nunez saw his big night going, and it certainly wasn’t how Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool envisaged it either. The Uruguayan’s home debut, his first Premier League start, lasted just 57 minutes, and ended in the ignominy of a straight red card in front of the Kop.  When we talked about Nunez making a big impact on Merseyside, we didn’t imagine that impact would be made on the chin of Joachim Andersen, the Crystal Palace defender who was left flattened by the Reds striker’s obvious, and staggeringly daft, headbutt. Nunez’s indiscipline cost Liverpool on the night, as they laboured to a 1-1 draw which means that, for the first time in a decade, they have failed to win either of their opening two games in a Premier League campaign.  It could have been worse too: a goal down at the time of the dismissal, were it not for Luis Diaz’s brilliance, or Wilfried Zaha’s late miss, they’d have been nursing their first home league defeat in 17 months. Klopp stated afterwards that he was “proud” of his team’s response with 10 men, and said he would speak to his new £64 million ($76m) signing about his moment of madness. Whatever provocation there was from Andersen – and it was relatively minor, given the compilation videos circulating on social media – there can be no excuse for such a reaction, especially with VAR in operation and the referee, Paul Tierney, looking straight at the incident in any case. Nunez’s indiscretion will cost him, and it will cost Liverpool. He will now miss three games through suspension, starting with next Monday’s trip to Manchester United, and at a time when Klopp’s resources are already stretched worryingly thin, this was a headache he could ill afford. A moment of madness from Darwin Núñez and he's shown a straight red card! 🤯 pic.twitter.com/YAErzuuUKq “Because we have no other striker,” was Klopp’s response when asked why he had chosen Nunez to start against Palace. He was smiling as he delivered the line, but he was telling the truth. With Diogo Jota sidelined and Roberto Firmino also ruled out, Nunez had to play. Even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has been used occasionally as a (rather awkward-looking) centre-forward in the past, is injured. Two games into the season, Liverpool’s squad is creaking. They currently have 10 first-team players out, and two more – Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson – were deemed fit enough only for a place on the bench against Palace after minor issues. Firmino and Joel Matip were the latest to fall, Matip reporting a groin injury ahead of training on Friday, which Klopp says will keep him out for around two weeks, and Firmino picking up an as-yet-unknown issue over the weekend. “I’ve never known a week like it,” Klopp said in his post-match press conference on Monday. “It was like we had a witch in the building, honestly! Every day, somebody else pulled out [of training] for the craziest reasons.” Nunez’s silliness, then, was the last thing he needed, although for once he will be grateful for the fixture list, which gives his team a full week to prepare for the United game.  He hopes Firmino, at least, will have a chance of returning for that, but Matip is out, Jota is still a couple of weeks away, and Oxlade-Chamberlain, Thiago Alcantara, Ibrahima Konate and Curtis Jones are still on the treatment table. Even the No.2 goalkeeper, Caoimhin Kelleher, summer signing Calvin Ramsay and teenage star Kaide Gordon are crocked. The first red card for violent conduct of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool reign 😡 pic.twitter.com/DkVmOCSygA It all adds up to a challenge, and one which will intensify calls for Liverpool to look to solve their problems in the transfer market. News that Wolves have agreed a deal to sign Matheus Nunes, the Sporting Lisbon midfielder who has been linked with the Reds recently, will have gone down like a lead balloon with supporters in that regard. Klopp insists Liverpool won’t panic buy, and we should take him at his word, but this has been a troubling start to the campaign, one which already leaves them playing catch up with Manchester City, and which places added pressure on that trip to Old Trafford next week. Lose there, against the league’s crisis club, and the knives will be out for sure. That’s the price of success, sadly, and the standards set by Liverpool in recent years are such that any drop – such as a couple of below-par results – is going to create chatter. Their job now is to quieten that chatter, and that can only be done through wins and through convincing performances. For now, they’re going to have to achieve those without Nunez.  The new boy will learn from his mistake, for sure, and will almost certainly go on to become a big player for Liverpool in the coming months and years, but his stupidity has left his team, and his manager, facing a tricky few weeks.",Football,Match,False,34923,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSilKQ27KDqPZplzvDl_t91TxbXeKMsWIpZow&s
Spurs close to sealing £50m Richarlison transfer with Everton forward set to undergo medical,"Tottenham are closing in on the signing of Richarlison from Everton, GOAL can confirm, with the Brazil international forward set to undergo a medical. It appeared at one stage as though the 25-year-old would be heading to north London as a new addition at Arsenal, but the Gunners have turned their attention to alternative Samba stars such as Gabriel Jesus and Raphinha. That has left a door open for Spurs to swoop in, with another proven Premier League performer being added to Antonio Conte’s ranks on the back of deals for Fraser Forster and Yves Bissouma. It is understood that Spurs will be splashing out an initial £50 million ($61m) fee in order to get a deal for Richarlison over the line. An agreement reached with Premier League rivals includes the option for a further £10m ($12m) to be paid in add-ons. Reports suggest that the South American star will be committing to a five-year contract with Spurs through to the summer of 2027. Personal terms have been agreed, with medical tests the last box to be ticked before the relevant paperwork can be completed. The press. The finish. 👌@richarlison97 👏#EVECHE pic.twitter.com/H20ueCW3HQ Tottenham already boast plenty of firepower in their ranks, with England captain Harry Kane very much a talismanic presence in the final third of the field. They also have Son Heung-min on their books, with the South Korean forward claiming a share of the Premier League Golden Boot last season. Sweden international Dejan Kulusevski impressed on the back of his loan move from Juventus in January, but questions have been asked of how long Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn will be sticking around. Conte is eager to avoid leaving himself short of options in an important area of the field, with Richarlison being drafted in as another ready-made starter. He has, having first arrived in English football at Watford in 2017, reached double figures when it comes to goals in each of the last four seasons.

'The pinnacle of individual achievements' - Ronaldo reacts to winning FIFA Special Best award,"Cristiano Ronaldo says it was a ""tremendous honour"" to win the FIFA Special Best Award on Monday. The Portugal star was handed the trophy in recognition of him becoming the highest-scoring men's player in international football history. Ronaldo broke the record set by former Iran hero Ali Daei in September when he scored his 110th goal for his country. He has since taken his tally up to 115. FIFA unveiled the special accolade for the 36-year-old during The Best Awards ceremony in Zurich and the attacker expressed his delight on social media.    ""Winning The FIFA Special Best Award is a tremendous honor and a huge privilege,"" he wrote in an Instagram post.  ""The fact that such a relevant institution chose to recognize me as the Top Goalscorer in the history of FIFA competitions is, for me, the pinnacle of my individual achievements in representation of my beloved country. ""Now, it’s up to me to turn this award into extra fuel and motivation to help achieving all our goals at Man. United for this season, as well as to the upcoming play-off matches in March, so that Portugal can be at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and we can all keep writing this amazing story together. ""Last but not least, a special word to all the tremendous players that represented Portugal by my side over the last two decades, and to all the international players that I faced so many times all around the globe. Your talent, your professionalism and your quality always contributed to make me a better player."" The five-time Ballon d'Or winner will turn 37 in less than three weeks, on February 5. Despite his age, Ronaldo feels he can keep playing into his forties, as he said at the ceremony in Zurich: “I still have the passion for the game. Not just to score goals. It’s to entertain myself because I’ve played football since I was five, six years old. When I go out on the pitch, even in training, I’m still enjoying it and my motivation is still there. Even though I’m going to be 37 soon, I feel good, I feel motivated, I have been working hard since I was 18 years old and I continue to.  “I love the game. I still have that passion. I want to continue. People ask me sometimes how many more years I’m going to play and I say I hope to play another four, five years.

"Bundesliga odds: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund & the top teams’ chances of winning in 2021-22","Having won the Bundesliga title in each of the last nine seasons, Bayern Munich are already well on course to complete their historic 10 in a row in 2022. New coach Julian Nagelsmann has picked up where predecessor Hansi Flick left off, leading his team to the Herbstmeister position of sitting top of the league at the winter break. Boasting a nine-point lead at the top of the table, Bayern are once again threatening to run away with a league they have completely dominated over the past decade. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about the favourites and outsiders for the Bundesliga title in 2021-22. Having picked up 14 wins from their opening 17 fixtures to pull comfortably clear of the chasing pack, Bayern Munich are now overwhelming 1/50 (1.02) favourites with bet365 to go all the way to the title once again. The record 31-times champions are still spearheaded by the evergreen Robert Lewandowski, whose 19 goals from 17 league matches so far puts him well on course to win a fifth consecutive Golden Boot. With Dayot Upamecano and Marcel Sabitzer having followed manager Nagelsmann from last season’s runners-up RB Leipzig to the Allianz Arena in the summer, the gap appears to be widening between Bayern and the rest of the league. Indeed, RB Leipzig have fallen dramatically away into mid-table since losing their coach and key players, leaving them as huge 250/1 (251.0) outsiders to lift the league trophy for the first time. Instead, it is traditional rivals Borussia Dortmund who offer the best hope of preventing the title returning to Munich this campaign, priced at 18/1 (19.0) to be crowned champions for the first time since 2012. Dortmund certainly possess players capable of reaching the very top, none more so than Erling Haaland and his record of 53 goals in 54 Bundesliga matches. The Norway international has started just 10 league games this season (scoring 13 goals) due to injuries, so keeping him fit could prove central to an unlikely title bid in the second half of the campaign. Marco Rose’s men did push Bayern all the way in a 3-2 defeat at the Westfalenstadion at the beginning of December and remain their only potential challengers to what looks like a one-horse race. While the title race has been a closed shop over the past 10 years, Germany’s battle for the top four is once again providing plenty of intrigue. Dortmund have remained almost ever-presents in the Champions League - finishing in the top four in 10 of the last 11 seasons - and are priced at just 1/150 (1.01) to maintain that record this time out. However, RB Leipzig are now at Evens (2.0) to secure their place for a fourth year in a row as they sit six points adrift in 10th at halfway.  Bayer Leverkusen’s days as Champions League regulars are a distant memory after just one top-four finish in the last five seasons but they are now 8/11 (1.73) to return to Europe’s top table as they occupy fourth place. Neck-and-neck with Leverkusen on 28 points, Hoffenheim are 9/4 (3.25) to achieve a Champions League spot for just the third time in their relatively short top-flight history. Freiburg have never reached the Champions League and are dark horses at 5/2 (3.50) despite sitting in third as we enter 2022, with Christian Streich’s team having achieved some eye-catching results so far. Both just a point adrift of fourth-placed Leverkusen, Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt can be backed at 4/1 (5.0) and 8/1 (9.0) to really upset the established order by claiming a place at Europe’s top table. Mainz are on offer at 9/1 (10.0) as they begin the new year just four points shy of fourth place in ninth position, while Koln are a longer 16/1 (17.0) despite sitting a point ahead in eighth place. Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+.

Who is Tyrell Malacia? Everything you need to know about Manchester United's £13m transfer target,"Erik ten Hag's Dutch revolution is underway at Manchester United as the former Ajax manager closes in on the signing of Tyrell Malacia, a player he will have seen plenty of times in Eredivisie. Malacia, who shares an agent with fellow United target Frenkie de Jong, is on the verge of moving to Old Trafford for around £13 million ($16m), plus add-ons, making him the club's first signing of the summer. Indeed, the Red Devils appear to have successfully hijacked Lyon's move for Malacia, with West Ham also among those interested. The 22-year-old Dutch defender is a marauding left-back, having been deployed in that position for both Feyenoord and the Netherlands national team. Catch him if you can 💨Tyrell Malacia scores his first senior goal for Feyenoord! 👏 pic.twitter.com/TFJH4rkON1 Born in Rotterdam, Malacia joined Feyenoord's youth academy in 2008 at the age of nine. He signed his first professional contract in 2015 and made his debut two years later in a Champions League win over Napoli. Malacia played the full 90 minutes against the Serie A side in Rotterdam that night and was then handed his Eredivisie debut seven days later against Heerenveen. In total, Malacia has made 136 appearances for Feyenoord, scoring four goals. The left-back won the KNVB Cup with the Dutch club in 2017-18 and the Johan Cruyff Shield in 2018. He was a member of the Feyenoord team that made it to the final of the UEFA Conference League in 2021-22, losing to Jose Mourinho's Roma in the final. Malacia played 88 minutes of that match and was named in UEFA's Team of the Tournament for his performances across the competition. Malacia has represented the Netherlands from youth level to the senior national team. Born in Rotterdam to a Curacaoan father and Surinamese mother, Malacia has represented the country of his birth since earning his first U-16 call-up in 2014. He went on to play for the U-17s, 18s, 19s, 20s and 21s before finally earning his senior debut in 2021 against Montenegro. In total, he has five senior caps and will be aiming to be part of Louis van Gaal's squad for the World Cup. The deal to bring Malacia to United came out of the blue, with the Netherlands international having been set to join Lyon until Ten Hag's side came in and agreed a deal with Feyenoord. West Ham are also said to have been interested, but Malacia is set to choose to be a part of the rebuilding process in Manchester. At 22 years old, Malacia has plenty of time to develop at United and will challenge Luke Shaw and Alex Telles for the left-back role. It doesn't bode well for Brandon Williams' future at the club, however, with the defender having returned from a loan spell at Norwich City but now seemingly fourth choice in the pecking order.",Football,Analysis,False,902,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt186aeaa0bfc9f62c/Audero.jpg
'Nunez should have pulled his hair!' - NBA star Josh Hart makes referee dig after Liverpool headbutt incident,"WHAT HAPPENED: NBA star Josh Hart says Darwin Nunez would have avoided an early bath if he had pulled Joachim Andersen's hair rather than headbutting the defender at Anfield in a reference to an incident at the weekend between Tottenham's Cristian Romero and Chelsea's Marc Cucurella. Ouch! In the @premierleague you cant head butt….he should have just pulled his hair. He wouldn’t have got anything THE BIGGER PICTURE: Premier League match officials are in the spotlight again after a series of controversial incidents during the second weekend of the new season. Nunez was shown a straight red card for violent conduct after his clash with Andersen, which will bring an automatic three-match ban.

Ronaldo to miss Man Utd's meeting with Liverpool following death of baby son,"Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Manchester United's Premier League meeting with Liverpool on Tuesday night following the death of his baby son. Ronaldo made the heartbreaking announcement via his Instagram account on Monday, during which he also revealed the birth of a baby girl with his long-term partner, Georgina Rodriguez. The couple had been expecting twins, but asked for privacy after the loss and United have now confirmed Ronaldo will be taking a period of compassionate leave. Ronaldo, who has scored 21 goals for the Red Devils since returning to the club from Juventus last summer, won't be in Ralf Rangnick's squad for their trip to Anfield. The club have released a statement on their website confirming the news, which reads: ""Family is more important than everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time. ""As such, we can confirm that he will not feature in the match against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday evening and we underline the family's request for privacy. ""Cristiano, we are all thinking of you and sending strength to the family."" Ronaldo and his family have been sent a number of messages from high-profile figures and clubs across the game since the announcement, including his United team-mates Marcus Rashford and David De Gea. Rashford wrote on Twitter: ""Thoughts are with you and Georgina brother I'm so sorry."" Thoughts are with you and Georgina brother ♥️ I’m so sorry Liverpool legend Sir Kenny Dalglish also replied to Ronaldo's original post: ""Sending our heartfelt condolences to you and your family for your unimaginable loss."" Ronaldo's former club Real Madrid have said they are ""deeply saddened"" by the news, with a statement from the club adding: ""Real shares in the family's pain and wishes to send them all of our warmth.""

Ronaldo's record-breaking night proves new Man Utd boss Rangnick can rely on him,"If Cristiano Ronaldo felt the need to send a message to his new manager – after all the talk that he would not fit into his setup – then scoring twice to secure Manchester United three points against Arsenal is one way to do it.  Ralf Rangnick was in the stands to watch his new team and while he will have seen plenty of problems that need rectifying, Ronaldo would not appear to be among them. Rangnick was on his feet applauding the Portuguese for his 800th and 801st career goals respectively.  Whether he presses enough or not, he still should be considered for the starting XI every week.  As he made his run into the box in the 52nd minute, the Arsenal players knew what was coming. A low Marcus Rashford cross came into the box and Ronaldo was there to finish it.  He has also now taken over penalty duties from Bruno Fernandes and dispatched what proved to be the winning goal from the spot after Martin Odegaard fouled Fred.  It is that inevitability, almost a guarantee of goals, that has led to managers tailoring their teams around the 36-year-old.  Ronaldo has an aura around him; just ask the fan who ran onto the pitch with 86 minutes on the clock in an attempt to get a selfie with him.  However, you don’t get the sense that Rangnick will bow down to him and, in a week when he made his feelings known about yet another Lionel Messi Ballon d’Or, maybe that’s why Ronaldo seemed so determined to prove a point against Arsenal.  Two goals will certainly help his cause but his work off the ball is more likely to impress Rangnick. He hassled the Arsenal back line all evening, chasing loose balls and putting in a shift at both ends of the pitch.  With United holding on to a 3-2 lead, he cleared an Arsenal corner before sprinting the length of the pitch in an attempt to get on the end of a counterattack.  Rangnick, who sat making notes throughout the game, will no doubt have questions to answer about Ronaldo in the days and weeks to come. But whether he should start or not should not be one of them.  Since he rejoined the club, he has scored three winning goals in the Premier League and has single-handedly kept them in the Champions League with six goals in five group-stage games. Without his contribution, they would not be through to the last 16 with a game to play.  However, while Ronaldo’s name might have been struck off the to-do list, there are still a few issues to resolve. For starters, United are still conceding too many goals. Emile Smith-Rowe’s bizarre opener means they have conceded in 15 consecutive home games in all competitions – their worst run since 1959.  There are issues with control and dominance in midfield and, at times, they were again slow and pedestrian.  Credit should go to Michael Carrick, the stand-in coach who tearfully stepped away from the club at full time.  He stepped up at a time when the team were in dire need of direction and led them to two big victories and a draw against one of the favourites to win the league this term in Chelsea.  Now, it’s over to Rangnick.  If Carrick can pass on any advice to him as he departs, it is the importance of Ronaldo.  “He has been terrific this week, especially for me, the things I’ve asked of him and the way he has gone about his business in and around the place, he's been absolutely top top drawer,” Carrick said. “No surprise he goes and scores tonight, the perfect ending really.”  Rangnick won’t be sure of many things on his first day in the job but he knows one thing for certain: he’ll be able to rely on Ronaldo.",Football,Rumor,False,49682,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/getty-2215382859/crop/MM5DEMZSGA5DCMZQGU5G433XMU5DEMR2GI3TO===/GettyImages-2215382859.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
"Attila Szalai transfer to Chelsea a 'done deal', claims Hungary coach Rossi amid £20m move rumours","Speculation regarding a move to Chelsea for Fenerbahce defender Attila Szalai has been building over recent weeks, and Hungary boss Marco Rossi claims that a January deal has been agreed. The 23-year-old only moved to Turkey in the winter transfer window of 2021, but another switch could be on the cards 12 months on. However, Fenerbahce have subsequently released a statement denying Szalai is on the brink of a transfer away from the club. Rossi, who coaches the highly-rated centre-half at international level, is not surprised to see the Blues swooping in as Szalai would not look out of place in any of Europe’s top divisions. When asked to picked out players in the Hungarian ranks that could make an impact in Serie A, Italian coach Rossi told Calciomercato: “It’s hard to name just one player, but right now I see very well Attila Szalai, who plays for Fenerbahce, but I think he is joining Chelsea. “Clearly, he has been followed by important clubs in Spain, but apparently his move to Chelsea is a done deal. He would be a great player also for Italian football.” In response to those comments Fenerbahce issued a firm denial. ""The allegations regarding the transfer of our player Attila Szalai, which have been made public in the last few days, based on foreign press and social media, do not reflect the truth,"" read a statement. Rossi is right to suggest that Szalai has been attracting admiring glances from leading sides in La Liga. Sevilla and Atletico Madrid have been credited with interest, while even Barcelona were said to be monitoring a player of considerable promise at one stage. Chelsea would appear to have won the race for a much sought-after signature, with it reported that the Blues will be parting with around £20 million ($26m) in order to get a deal over the line. Thomas Tuchel has been scouring the market for another centre-half at Stamford Bridge for a while. Sevilla star Jules Kounde was identified as a top target over the summer, but the France international proved to be out of reach. Efforts are now being stepped up to tick that particular box, with the current Champions League holders aware of the need to get bodies on board. With Antonio Rudiger running his contract down towards free agency in 2022, and with Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta also approaching the final six months of their respective deals, the Premier League heavyweights are wary of leaving themselves short in an important position.",Football,Rumor,False,21183,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltbacc0a6caff4fe89/GOAL%20-%20Blank%20WEB%20-%20Facebook%20(5).jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Swedish FA boss: World Cup play-off against Russia almost unthinkable amid Ukraine invasion,"The chairman of the Swedish Football Association (SvFF) has admitted that a 2022 World Cup play-off clash with Russia is “almost unthinkable” at this stage, following the decision of Vladimir Putin to send troops into Ukraine. Political tension in Eastern Europe continues to intensify, with a military invasion now underway. Those actions may impact on sporting matters, with Russia due to take part in important fixtures that have places at a major finals in Qatar up for grabs. With the winner of a meeting between Russia and Poland on March 24 due to face the victors of a tie involving Sweden and the Czech Republic, two high-profile fixtures could take place on Russian soil. Karl-Erik Nilsson, chairman of the Swedish FA, has, however, admitted that his country would find it difficult to make such a trip. He has told Reuters: “It's a possible scenario. Spontaneously around the feelings we have as we wake up this morning are that it is almost unthinkable that we in a few weeks would play a football match in Russia. “As it looks here and now, today, there is absolutely no desire to play a football match in Russia.” He added: “Our thoughts go to our friends in Ukraine over the situation they woke up to today, it's awful. Football should be seen as something of less importance in the middle of this inferno.” There have been suggestions that Russia should be taken out of the reckoning for World Cup qualification, but Nilsson says it is too early to be making decisions of such magnitude. The 64-year-old former referee said: “I believe that [in these situations] much is called for very quickly - we will need to live and socialise even in the future, and I think we shouldn't be too quick with solutions. “Instead, we should take our time and see what actions are needed. For the moment we are looking forward to arms being laid down and that peace and freedom come into existence.” He added when quizzed on whether the desires of those in Ukraine could shape football’s response to an escalating conflict: “It's important that the requests come from Ukraine. “At the moment they have a lot more to think about than football, but a future will arrive one day and we must show solidarity with our football friends around Europe.” Ukraine are also due to be in play-off action on March 24, when they face Scotland for the right to take on Wales or Austria in the Path A final. They also have UEFA Nations League outings to come in the summer, with the Republic of Ireland due to visit Lviv on June 14. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) has said in a statement relating to that fixture: “The FAI will continue to communicate on an ongoing basis with our Government, our colleagues at UEFA and the Ukraine Association of Football with regards to the latest developments and the implications for the Ukraine v Republic of Ireland fixture in the UEFA Nations League, currently fixed for Lviv on Tuesday, June 14th. “The FAI will also welcome Ukraine to Dublin on June 4th for the opening fixture in the UEFA Nations League campaign. The FAI awaits the outcome of the UEFA ExCo meeting on Friday, February 25th which has been called to discuss the current situation in the Ukraine.”",Football,Update,False,22698,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt4b2178aba8384ca2/Guglielmo%20Vicario%20Tottenham%20HIC.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
"Man Utd target Arnautovic has received offer from a 'well-known club', ex-West Ham striker's agent confirms","Marko Arnautovic has been the subject of a transfer bid from a ""well-known"" club, his agent has said, with GOAL having confirmed that Manchester United are interested in the Bologna striker. Arnautovic has emerged on the Red Devils' radar as they look to strengthen in attack before the end of the summer transfer window. It has been reported they have already had an offer of around €9 million (£8m/$9m) turned down by the Serie A side. The 33-year-old's agent and brother, Danijel Arnautovic, has confirmed that an approach has been made and revealed that the player is open to the move. ""It's true that there is an offer from a well-known club,"" he told Kurier.  ""I'm in contact with Bologna to see if that can be realised."" United are still in the process of rebuilding the team under new coach Erik ten Hag. They have invested in defence and midfield so far this summer, signing Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Christian Eriksen. However, they are yet to freshen up the attack and are at risk of being deprived of options over the season. Anthony Martial is already out injured, while star forward Cristiano Ronaldo could still leave the club, having reportedly declared his desire to make a move this summer. Arnautovic spent six years in England playing for Stoke and West Ham before leaving for China in 2019 and has been highlighted as an option for the Old Trafford side. However, coach Ten Hag refused to comment on a possible move for him after his side's 2-1 loss to Brighton on Sunday. He said: ""I don't go into names because I think in this pre-season 250 players are involved or linked with Manchester United, so that's it. We have two strikers, maybe a third one, with Marcus Rashford as well.""",Football,Analysis,False,31848,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5IWw7mcLWA650aexj2L3oqYWhpmV5ta-6fw&s
Can Mendy eclipse Salah and Mane as Chelsea meet Liverpool in FA Cup final?,"You are only as good as your last performance, and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy knows this more than most after the criticism he has received in recent weeks. The Blues' number one and Africa Cup of Nations winner’s game has been beset with high-profile errors that have cost the West Londoners of late, thus seeing supporters lose the faith and assuredness they had with the shot-stopper between the sticks. Mendy’s dip since the last international break has been so bad that a rising section of the club’s followers will not question any decision to utilise Kepa Arrizabalaga in Saturday’s FA Cup final against Liverpool. The Senegal goalkeeper’s drop off has coincided with the Blues’ worst run of results in 2021-22 in which they have fallen to four defeats in all competitions since the start of April, one more than they had managed with the 30-year-old in goal hitherto. Even though glaring errors have been limited to games against Brentford and Real Madrid, a deterioration in the Senegal international’s shot-stopping has precipitated the ongoing criticism and a few calls for a Kepa recall on Saturday. It seems a long time ago that Mendy delivered a world-class showing at the Brentford Community Stadium, making a staggering six saves in the final half-hour to preserve the London outfit’s 1-0 lead or a top class Stamford Bridge performance in the Blues’ 3-0 success over Aston Villa. Against this weekend’s opponents, the goalkeeper has flourished too.  It was Mendy who preserved a precious point at Anfield when 10-man Chelsea played the entire second half with a player short and, more recently, delivered a stunning showing in the League Cup final in late February. That final ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, but it was anything but a damp squib, with both sides fashioning quality chances throughout the game. Two of Mendy’s six saves in that decider came in quick succession, saving a Naby Keita effort from just outside the area before throwing himself forward to deny Sadio Mane dispatching the rebound from six yards. It was at that end Petr Cech made an equally stunning save 10 years ago to thwart a bullet Andy Carroll header in the FA Cup final to protect Chelsea’s 2-1 lead, a game decided by the irrepressible Didier Drogba. Indeed, the sensible call would be trusting Mendy to reprise that Wembley performance from February as the West Londoners strive to reverse the trend of failed finals at the Home of Football. The Blues have suffered defeats in two successive finals — respectively beaten by Arsenal and Leicester City in 2019/20 and 2020/21 — and want to prevent a third straight loss in the sport’s oldest cup competition. Another victory at Wembley will take Chelsea’s haul of FA Cup wins to eight, one more than Liverpool whom they are currently tied on seven titles.  They moved level with the Reds in 2012 and could surpass the Merseyside giants who have not claimed this trophy since a Steven Gerrard-inspired performance in that rip-roaring 2006 final against West Ham United. Nullifying the threat of in-form Mane would largely be half the job done, while Mohamed Salah possesses the match-winning quality despite an extended lull that reads three goals in his last 19 games for club and country. 17 of those games have been for Liverpool though, and it is worrying that the Egyptian has failed to even hit a shot on target in 11 of those games. Mane, by contrast, has caught fire in the second half of the campaign, particularly in a central role which he has mostly occupied since the turn of the year. The Senegal superstar has found the back of the net seven times in 13 Premier League appearances since returning from Afcon duty in February, one fewer than the eight he managed in 20 games preceding the Nations Cup. It was the forward who, by and large, decided last month’s semi-final success over Manchester City, too, notching a brace against Pep Guardiola’s men in a 3-2 success, and will be Jurgen Klopp’s key man in this year’s final as the Reds chase a first title in 16 years. The stage is set for the repeat of the 2012 final, and there is a feeling the aforementioned African stars will either make or mar their side’s chances at the Home of Football.",Football,Match,False,20322,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/getty-2242658883/crop/MM5DINZYGQ5DENRZGE5G433XMU5DEORRGY4A====/GettyImages-2242658883.jpg?width=1400&upscale=true
'I went to the games and then straight to the tattoo shop!' - Football fans and their ink,"2022 marks the year of the UEFA Women's Euro and the FIFA Men’s World Cup. All this week, VICE and GOAL will be collaborating to publish insightful, interesting stories from the world of football and fan culture, introducing VICE fans to GOAL and GOAL fans to VICE. Footballers and tattoos walk hand in hand nowadays, with it rare for a top-flight game to go by without at least a handful of players sporting some ink on their body. For most players, their tattoos are a small reflection of their personalities, offering an insight into more than just their public image. Meanwhile, in the stands, increasing numbers of supporters are also keen to show off their tattoos, particularly those with a footballing theme. Supporting their club is an aspect of their personalities that these fans are keen to display, so we spoke to four such die-hards to understand the inspiration behind their tatts: VICE x GOAL: What’s your name? Harry Brinkley. How old are you? Twenty-three. And how many football tattoos do you have? Four in total, but it forms one big sleeve. How long have you had that for? It started in 2019 and it finished roughly late last year. So, all in all, two-and-a-half to three years. Why did you get it? Growing up, I was always massively into football. I always loved Barcelona. When I was a kid, Messi was my favourite player, so it sort of went together. Where did you get it done? I got it done by Sammy Kent. She used to work at a different tattoo shop, but she’s opening her own shop soon. She did all of it. Do you have any funny stories about tattoos? Erm, more so now I’ve got it finished. All the time in London on tubes and stuff, I’ll be on an escalator and I feel the person behind taking pictures of me, or stuff like that. That must be annoying? I’ve been stopped so many times, in places like the Nike shop in London. How do you feel about that? It's a bit awkward, especially when they don’t ask. The guy on the escalator, I literally turned around and saw this flash going off. I was like, ‘What are you doing?’ And he said, ‘I really like your tattoo’, which is cool, but he could have asked first! Do you have any plans on getting anymore of an extension on it? I think I will be getting the top done at some point, but that’ll be Chelsea-themed, because I support both. Do you have a design ready for that? I’ve got a few pictures in mind that I want to get on it. But it’s just a case when I’m sort of free and have the money to get it done. I can imagine it’ll be quite expensive. How much has it cost so far? I lost count halfway through! It’s definitely over £2,000 ($2,600), easily. I’m not sure of the grand total. Have you seen Barcelona play? I’ve been a few times. I’m actually going in May this year. With lockdown and stuff, it’s been hard recently. What’s your name? Manuel. And how old are you? I’m 55. So, how many football tattoos do you currently have? One here (points to his arm), the back of the head and one on this leg. And I’ve got the badge, but it’s all bandaged up on the leg due to an abscess. That's the reason why I can’t get to any of the matches. But I’ll be going next season when it starts, in October-ish time. You’ve got a season pass already? Yeah, I've got all of that. Two grand… I’ll go to all the home games and that. Where do you sit in the stadium? I sit near the flag, where they take the corner. That’s my area. No one can take that area. I want to see them taking the corners. When did you get your first tattoo and which one was it? This one (points at the back of his head) was eight years ago. What was the reason for it? It’s not to show people I’ve got a tattoo on the back of my head, it’s just like... Arsenal has always been my team. And this is the only way. I told the tattoo artist to put it there, so now everyone knows. I’ve got the jacket too in the wardrobe. I’ve got three jumpers of theirs. The jackets cost me £150 ($200) each. Bloody hell, that’s quite expensive! Yeah. Do you go to the same place to get your tattoos done? Yeah, I go to the same place. I go to London to get it done, up the Angel. It's a man I know there who does it cheap. Did he do your other non-football tattoos too? Yeah, he does. Does he do other people's football tattoos? Nah, he just did this one as a favour for me. He can’t touch anyone else’s, but he did that for me because I know the guy. Do you have any plans for anymore tattoos? No, because I think the prices have gone up. I guess you don’t really need anymore? My sister has loads of tattoos. Is it a family thing? Yeah, my dad, sister and the rest. What’s your full name? Trisha Bergonzi How old are you? I turned 73 on St. Patrick's Day. What a great day to have a birthday! It’s the best. Your football team is...? Liverpool. How long have you been a supporter of Liverpool? Since I was 12. And is there a reason as to why you became a supporter of Liverpool? Erm, it’s maybe because one of my cousins was a red hot Liverpool fan and I copied them, which wasn’t very nice for my father as he was an Evertonian! There were seven in my house, they were all Evertonians and I was the only one that wasn’t. Every Saturday morning, the buses used to go past mine, we had a pub in Scotland Road. The buses used to go past, they’d stop at the bus stop and they’d all be getting on, all the tough guys except me. I’d be hanging out of the window crying my eyes out. My dad locked me in and then he used to let me out at half-time. But I thought bugger him, I’m going to go anyway! So, I sneaked out and ran all the way to Anfield, which is quite the journey up a hill. Were you living quite far from the ground? Not too far. In a car it would take about eight mins or so. At full-time, I’d come back down to the pub and my father was sitting in the parlour with customers and friends. I stood with my hands behind my back, looking down. And I’d say to him, ‘Guess where I’ve been dad.' ‘Where you been, girl?’ ‘I’ve been to Anfield…’ It was murders, he had me by my hair and swung me all around! Bloody hell! It was serious business. Where I lived as well – the famous road, Scotland Road – that used to be the main road that all the lorry drivers used to go from the continent, from the Liverpool Docks to Scotland. Is the pub still in the family, or...? They knocked it down. Like most pubs? Yeah, they built the motorway. I think there were 156 pubs on Scotland Road. There’s two now. That’s sad. Yeah, I was born there and the flat we lived in is now listed. I used to play football there and they had these big black railings out in the street and they’re still there. It was the place we all played footy and that, you know, and they’re still there ‘til this day. That’s great, it's nice to know there’s something still there that you can remember. Lots of history in Liverpool. How many football tattoos do you have? Just the one. What was the reason for getting that? To pay homage to Liverpool Football Club. Where did you get it done? I got it done in Clerkenwell – Family Business Tattoo. The manager’s name is David – we call him Elvis because he’s got a big curled quiff! When did you get it done? Probably 10 years ago now. I wouldn’t go to anyone else and wouldn’t recommend anyone else either. How did you find out about the parlour? He was a customer of mine. Do you have other tattoos? No, just the Liverpool one. That’s amazing, I love that. Originally, I wanted to get the two birds, one on each arm. Do you have funny anecdotes or stories about your time supporting Liverpool? The best time was when we won the Champions League in Istanbul. I went out there… It was absolutely brilliant, the stories – you’d be here all day! I can imagine… I had all the players in front me on the plane in first class. It was just amazing. Such a great time. What’s your name? Nathan Jarvis. And how old are you? Forty-nine. How many tattoos do you have in total? In total, about 18 tattoos. And how many are football related? Six Chelsea ones. Nice, and can you talk me through them? The Chelsea emblem on the side of my leg, I had that done when Chelsea won the double in 2010. I got the European Cup one because I went to Munich to watch the final we won in 2012. And the following year we went to Amsterdam, Chelsea won the UEFA Cup in 2013. Did you get them done in Amsterdam and Munich? I went to the games, literally came home and pretty much went straight to the tattoo shop. Do you go to the same place every time? These three are all from the same place in Sunbury by Jason Davies. He's done all of them. What was the reason you got the first one? What spurred you on to get your first football tattoo? I’ve been going Chelsea since I was eight years old. My brother used to take me. As I got older, then I started getting tattoos.  I decided to get a small Chelsea emblem and then the other ones followed really. Going travelling around watching Chelsea and then going to European games and deciding to get the trophies tattooed on me. Do you plan on getting anymore? Probably not, no. Now that I'm approaching 50 I probably won’t have anymore tattoos. Well, football tattoos anyways. Do you have any stories or anecdotes to go with the tattoos? The trophy ones on my leg are about travelling away to Europe, and I don’t really remember too much about either of the trips! There is a bit of a story from when we were in Munich. Me and the group of friends spent time just outside of the town in a bar, because in the middle of the town it got really busy, so we stayed most of the day. It got to about 4 or 5pm, and we decided to head over to the game. Went to the train station and it was shut. So, we literally had a bit of panic, there were no taxis available as you can imagine everyone at that sort of time was going to the game. There was an open top bus going down the road. I decided to jump in the road and stop it. It was a Corona beer promotion bus full of Munich supporters, and after a bit of conversation with them, they let me and my four friends onto the bus and they drove around Munich. We had Chelsea flags on top of the bus and they dropped us at a station, and we just got on the train and got to the game! That’s funny, it’s kind of the opposite of how you’d want it to play out, jumping on a bus full of Munich supporters. Yeah, we literally got to the point where we knew we couldn’t get to the game. Obviously, we travelled to Munich the day before and were drinking and whatever. Got right to the last minute and we were sure we’d miss the game.

Chelsea complete £20m signing of teenage wonderkid midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa,"Chelsea have completed the signing of Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, the club announced on Thursday.  The London club had earlier confirmed that they had reached an agreement with Villa for the 18-year-old’s permanent transfer to Stamford Bridge. Thomas Tuchel is continuing to reinforce his squad ahead of the 2022-23 Premier League season, with Chukwuemeka the fourth arrival so far this summer after Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly, and Gabriel Slonina. It is reported that Chelsea have paid £15 million (€17.93m/$18.27m) for his services to Aston Villa, with a further £5 million in add-ons.  The midfielder has signed a six-year contract that will keep him at Chelsea until 2028. The 18-year-old is regarded as one of the brightest talents and played an instrumental part in helping England to achieve glory at the Under-19 European Championship. He even got on the scoresheet in the final against Israel and earned a place in the UEFA Team of the Tournament.  He started his youth career at  Northampton Town before switching to Villa at the age of 12. He made his  Premier League against Tottenham in May 2021 and a week later secured the FA Youth Cup trophy after beating Liverpool 2-1. He finished the tournament as the top scorer and was named Academy Player of the Season. To date, he has had 14 Premier League appearances and also became the club's youngest player to have a goal contribution in December’s 2-0 win over Norwich City. ""I’m so excited and just can’t wait to get on the pitch, meet all the players and try to win games and trophies with Chelsea,"" he said. ""It’s been quite hectic but I couldn’t get Chelsea out of my head the last few days so I’m just happy and relieved that it’s all done.""",Football,Exclusive,False,45072,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/getty-2219213719/crop/MM5DINZXHA5DENRYHA5G433XMU5DAORRGIZQ====/GettyImages-2219213719.jpg?width=1400&upscale=true
Ex-Man Utd starlet Ravel Morrison reunites with Rooney as D.C. United sign midfielder on free transfer,"Former Manchester United starlet Ravel Morrison has reunited with Wayne Rooney once again, with D.C. United confirming the capture of the midfielder on a free transfer. His deal will run through 2023 with an option to extend to 2024. The two men were once team-mates at Old Trafford, while Morrison also played under Rooney at Derby County last season. Morrison was released by the Rams at the end of his contract, but has now followed his last manager to Audi Field. Rooney stepped into the dugout at D.C. United on July 12, having also played for the MLS franchise at the end of his career, and has since been busy working on recruitment to take the club to the next level. D.C. United's president of soccer operations, Dave Kasper, has said of Morrison's arrival: ""Wayne worked closely with Ravel during his time as manager of Derby County. “Ravel is an incredible talent and his ability to create and score goals is impressive. He has played at the highest levels during his career and his vision, creativity and ability on the ball will be a huge asset for us."" Lucy Rushton, the club's general manager, added: ""Ravel is a dynamic and exciting player who has experience performing at the elite levels in Europe and Mexico. “He is a top-class midfielder with excellent technical ability and positional versatility. His game intelligence and all-round attacking ability allow him to fit perfectly in the system and style that Wayne wants to play.  ""We look forward to integrating him with the roster and having him contribute on the field as soon as possible.” Welcome to the Black-and-Red Family, Ravel 👏#DCU || @MorrisonRavel D.C. United are the 13th club that Morrison has played for across his 12-year career, which began with a failed stint at Old Trafford between 2010 and 2012. The 29-year-old has also turned out in the Premier League for West Ham and Sheffield United, while spending four years on Lazio's books in Italy between 2015-19. Morrison impressed for Derby last term despite their relegation from the Championship, recording four goals and four assists in 36 appearances. GOAL's American soccer correspondent Ryan Tolmich writes... Morrison is a risk worth taking for D.C. United, who have officially begun the team's overhaul under Rooney. That overhaul began with the deal to send Julian Gressel to Vancouver and is continuing with the signing of Morrison, who rejoins a familiar face in Rooney. Morrison's career has been up and down, to put it lightly, but he did well enough under Rooney at Derby as he now looks to find some sort of stability under the former Man Utd star. Under Rooney, D.C. is expected to play in a 4-2-3-1 system, with Morrison joining a midfield group that includes Russell Canouse, Chris Durkin and Moses Nyeman. Initially reported to be a Designated Player, Morrison instead arrives on a more affordable contract, with All-Star Taxi Fountas the team's only DP player as things stand. That means Rooney and D.C. have plenty of wiggle room to upgrade the roster if ownership are willing to spend.  Jesse Lingard has been linked and the allure of playing for Rooney will certainly appeal to several players looking to make the move to MLS. With D.C. sitting dead last in the Eastern Conference, they'll need any new signings to be true difference makers if they hope to salvage their season. That includes the mercurial Morrison, who certainly has the quality to make his mark on MLS and perhaps even stay a while if things can go to plan.",Football,Rumor,False,19396,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt2bd9464bae0dce63/goal---web-two-way-split--55346d7d-4efb-4ce4-901e-2d1e57677b25.jpeg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Youthful Arsenal can be a real force and aim for top four - Parlour,"Former Arsenal star Ray Parlour believes the club’s current crop of young talent can see the club become a real Premier League force once again - and that a top-four finish is not yet out of reach this season. The ex Gunners midfielder was part of Arsene Wenger’s legendary Invincibles side that cruised to the Premier League title unbeaten in 2004. The club has gone through a number of transitional phases since then but Parlour believes coach Mikel Arteta’s young, vibrant squad can lead the club back to English football’s top table. “It's a good young team. If they develop like they have been then they’ve got an excellent opportunity of getting back into the top four,” said Parlour, who was hosting guests of the club’s official betting partner Sportsbet.io at Arsenal’s 2-1 victory over Brentford last month. ""There are some big games still to come: Chelsea away, Tottenham away, Manchester United, all the teams that are going to be around that sort of area. Arsenal have got themselves in a good position."" The Gunners have the youngest average of any squad in the Premier League this season, including a number of stars who have risen through the club’s youth ranks. “The Academy has always been important,” said Parlour. “Seeing players come through like Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, and also Martin Odegaard, they’re all very, very young. Aaron Ramsdale’s very young, too. “Then there’s Ben White. If you look at the average age at the back, it’s 24, 25. So, if they can keep improving and keep listening to the coach and doing what he says, then hopefully they will have a very successful time.” Boss Mikel Areta has proved himself the coach for nurturing young talent, but Parlour believes the older members of the squad have a big role to play too. “You’ve got to have that little bit of experience as well,” he said. “I’m sure they’ll be looking up to captain Alexandre Lacazette and Granit Xhaka, saying this is how you conduct yourself. “You’ve got to have your own mind as well, but you always listen to people older than you. I did when I was playing. “People like Tony Adams and people like that helped my career. So I’m sure the young players will be looking at Lacazette and people a little bit older to see what their experience has been as well.” Parlour believes the final piece of the puzzle is a top class striker, and that returning to the top four could be vital to securing the right man to lead the line. “The transfer window is going to be very important in the summer, strikers-wise. But, if you can get fourth place, you can attract bigger players and champions league football next season. So, that’s going to be important.” As well as looking forward to the new, Parlour took a moment to look back. Asked what he would do with the current price of a bitcoin, the former England international said he’d honour former manager Arsene Wenger. “A statue of Arsene Wenger outside of the stadium. He developed this club so well,” said Parlour. “We’re sitting here at the Emirates today and this is all down to Arsene. The new training ground is all down to Arsene. ""I’m amazed that there’s not a statue put up already. So my £30,000 would go towards a statue of Arsene Wenger.” Ray Parlour was speaking to GOAL while hosting guests of Arsenal’s official betting partner, Sportsbet.io.

‘What a balls-up’ – Champions League draw fiasco stuns sporting world as Ronaldo vs Messi clash is wiped out,"The draw for the last 16 of the Champions League proved to be an eventful and rather chaotic affair, with Manchester United unwittingly finding themselves at the centre of a European storm after initially being paired with Paris Saint-Germain. That contest, which would have seen Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi rekindle their long-running rivalry, was eventually wiped out after UEFA admitted to a “technical problem” which forced them to carry out the entire procedure again. Unsurprisingly, interested observers from around the world were quick to ask questions of how European football’s governing body managed to find itself fire-fighting such a predicament. Just one tie had been pulled out of the hat when the last-16 draw descended into farce. Real Madrid had been paired with Benfica, before Villarreal became the third ball to be extracted from a pot of group-stage runners-up. Ex-Arsenal star Andrey Arshavin then proceeded to unfurl the name of Manchester United, but the Red Devils had already faced supposed La Liga opposition in this season’s competition. That error was quickly spotted, leading to Manchester City being lined up against Villarreal, but United were not added back in for the next tie to be drawn against Atletico Madrid – as Bayern Munich were handed a heavyweight encounter with Spanish foes. The draw was eventually completed, with Messi and PSG left until last alongside Ronaldo and United, but concerns were already being raised behind the scenes, with Atletico among those to lodge an official complaint. UEFA then announced that the initial fixture list was null and void, with a second draw added to the schedule – much to the annoyance of La Liga giants Real Madrid who were happy with their lot and had managed to steer clear of any scandal. Following a technical problem with the software of an external service provider that instructs the officials as to which teams are eligible to play each other, a material error occurred in the draw for the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. While condemnation of UEFA’s errors quietened quickly once an error of its ways had been acknowledged, the entire episode left many dazed and confused. What a balls-up. And the ""software"" excuse ranks in ""the dog ate my homework"" category. #UCLdraw https://t.co/8ImoVHe39U Statement from UEFA: Max Verstappen has been declared the winner of this season’s Champions League.

Will @UEFA redo the whole draw or just pick it up from when the mistake was made? Either way, if a mistake was made it surely has to be done again?

PSG star Di Maria agrees one-year contract to join Juventus on free transfer,"Paris Saint-Germain star Angel Di Maria will join Juventus on a free transfer this summer, with GOAL confirming that he has agreed to a one-year contract at the Allianz Stadium. Di Maria has spent the last seven years of his career with PSG, winning a whole host of domestic trophies, but the club have decided against extending his contract beyond the summer. The 34-year-old will play his final game for the Ligue 1 champions against Metz on May 21 and is set to become a free agent the following month, with Juve poised to lure him to Italy. GOAL has learned that Juve have reached an agreement to sign Di Maria on a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season. The Italian giants will also have the option of keeping the Argentine for an extra year, with negotiations between all parties concerned having advanced quickly over the past 24 hours. PSG invested €52 million (£44m/$65m) in Di Maria's talents in 2015 as they prised him away from Manchester United, which has ultimately proved to be a bargain deal. The veteran attacker has helped the club win five Ligue 1 titles, five Coupe de France crowns and three Trophee des Champions, while also playing a key role in their run to the 2019-20 Champions League final. Di Maria has contributed 92 goals to PSG's cause across 294 appearances, while also setting up another 118 for his team-mates, and will likely be remembered as one of the club's best players in recent years.",Football,Exclusive,False,1131,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltbcac3006e5b4a735/Rizky%20Ridho%20Ole%20Romeny.jpg?width=1400&upscale=true

The 19-year-old emerged as a breakout star in 2021, winning the NWSL Rookie of the Year award and leading the Spirit to the league title.  The USWNT's January camp will take place in Austin, Texas from January 19-28, and will not include any matches.  “Without any matches that we need to taper for, we can get in some more intense trainings and full-field scrimmages, which is great as we need to give this group as many chances as possible to play together in a national team environment,” Andonovski said in a federation press release.  Rodman is the youngest player on the roster and is followed by the top pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft, Naomi Girma, who is 21. Andonovski has left off a number of the team's veteran stars like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath, and Becky Sauerbrunn, as he aims to evaluate players looking ahead to the 2023 World Cup.

EA Sports vs Konami: How FIFA won the football gaming war against PES and eFootball ,"At one point on a Saturday night in early December, while 25,000 people on the streaming platform Twitch simultaneously tuned in to watch people play FIFA 22, only 19 watched the competing game eFootball 2022. The cultural gap between EA Sports’ FIFA franchise and Konami’s eFootball - a rebrand of its once dominant Pro Evolution Soccer title - has grown wider than ever this year, with eFootball 2022 players looking like zombies and game mode options a skeleton of past iterations. Even Konami loyalists are having a difficult time justifying the use of their time on what is widely considered an incomplete game. For those faithful fans who have stuck around even as popularity waned since the mid-2000s glory years of PES, and who would like to keep supporting the game publisher, the recent setback has been particularly difficult to take. “I feel like they sold us a lot of hope, and what we got was very disappointing,” YouTube video maker Bryan Bryezer told GOAL about how the end product of eFootball 2022 compares to its pre-launch hype. “So you know, it does feel like a slap in the face almost, because as a loyal PES fan you get the game every year. ""It's unbelievable, to be honest, a company with this much pedigree, releasing a game that's almost unplayable.” PES was once widely considered the better football simulation due to advanced game play immersion for its time and expansive customisation features. It didn’t carry the licensing breadth of EA but that never mattered. Nuances, such as an AI system that realistically punished poor decision-making, existed in those games that are not even fully realised today. But it’s been well over a decade since Konami outsold FIFA for a football game; in 2018, worldwide sales bottomed out at 550,000 copies compared to FIFA’s 12.2 million. This year, Konami has offered eFootball for free in a gambit to bring back some of its lost market share. The glitch-laden release, however, has done little to help bolster its public image. “We are very sorry for the problems, and want to assure everyone we will take all concerns seriously and strive to improve the current situation,” wrote Konami in a statement amid the instant backlash to eFootball 2022. Konami has since promised a significant springtime update to its game, which is expected to bring back familiar game modes such as Master League and Become A Legend, as well as a new mobile launch. The company hopes these developments will begin to right the wrongs of eFootball 2022’s troubled release. But can it realistically make the game acceptable for users in a short time given its recent missteps, not only regaining hardcore supporters but also adding new ones? And even if the update improves matters significantly, would it be too late? To understand the context of Konami’s stake in football, it helps to look back at the history of its rivalry with EA Sports and the importance of console generation transitions like the one the video game world is in now.  Let’s start with Konami at its peak delivering one of its finest titles at the end of the life cycle of the PlayStation 2, which it had already dominated to that point. Maybe it’s just nostalgia talking, but many people will tell you the Japanese conglomerate offered one of the best, if not the best, football video game ever made in Pro Evolution Soccer 5 (also known as Winning Eleven 9) in August 2005.  “You were fully immersed in the drama,” said Marlon Anthony, a YouTube creator who has done extensive documentary work on the history of PES and FIFA. “I think it was magic. It was magic in a bottle.” PES 5 received an 8.3 average user score on Metacritic; FIFA 06 came out the same year and received a 7.8. Anthony picks PES 5 out above the rest having gone back and played football games as far back as the 90s in order to document their evolution. Compared to more recent games, he said, the competitive intensity needed to succeed is refreshing. “The player is rewarded for their patience and your opponent punished for bad decision making as well,” he said. “Modern games try too much to make the player feel like they're [winning], and everything you want to do just happens for you, regardless of whether it could make sense for your players body shape, or for the team's positioning on the pitch.  “PES 5 was quite unforgiving in nature, you really had to work for your goals. And if you rushed a pass, or you rushed a shot, you understood why something failed. Whereas I think now regardless of the context, if the player requests to shoot, regardless of whether it makes sense, or whether it should be successful, nine times out of 10, it goes on target and is a goal. You kind of feel unfulfilled because you feel like you didn't even mean to shoot in that manner.” Knowing they had a dynamite product, Konami was extremely confident in this era and willing to take risks. It even put a referee on the cover of a game, and included a mode where one could swap human players for penguins and dinosaurs. “We could do anything at that point,” former Konami public relations chief Steve Merrett told The Guardian of the company’s confidence level during the PlayStation 2 era. And for a while, they did. But once the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were released, ushering in an all-important next-gen transition period, EA Sports quickly took control of the playground. Around this time, FIFA became increasingly important to EA as the company consolidated its sports video game titles. It lost rights to MLB after 2005 and gave up on college baseball in 2007. By 2011, Take-Two Interactive had obliterated EA in basketball with the soaring NBA 2K series leaving EA’s NBA Live franchise far behind. By 2014, production of its popular NCAA Football game had stopped amid legal challenges. The desperation to succeed in football, then, led to an era of inventiveness and quick progress. FIFA 09 was not only arguably the most important title in modern football video game history, but also arguably the most consequential in modern sports game history, period. That’s because it introduced FIFA Ultimate Team - the build-your-fantasy-squad game mode featuring shiny virtual cards representing players usable in actual matches.  The game mode, as addictive as anything one will find in the sports gaming genre, is now a staple of other EA sports franchises as well as NBA 2K and San Diego Studios’ MLB The Show. “Obviously that was the big turning point where it was like, OK, it used to be about how the game played and how it looked and all this kind of stuff, and now it's about the fact that FIFA has Ultimate Team,” said game reviewer Jordan Oloman. “Ultimate Team is the massive golden goose that is making all the money. And as you know, if you're a teenager, like I was when Ultimate Team first came out, it was the biggest thing ever. “It's that cult of Ultimate Team that makes everyone play FIFA over PES.” Indeed, the gameplay itself in FIFA 09 wasn’t perfect, with online users quickly figuring out that goalkeepers could be chipped rather easily from any outside-the-box angle, including straight from kick-off. However, the implementation of new features such as Ultimate Team, as well as improvements to Career Mode, helped draw interest and laid the groundwork for total domination throughout the 2010s. EA Sports had hit its stride - and it didn't need to pay as much attention to the rival slipping behind it. “After FIFA 08 we didn’t really look towards PES,” acknowledged former FIFA lead designer Gary Paterson to The Guardian. “We had so much we wanted to do. We spoke a lot about the shooting system, a more sophisticated version of what we’d created on PS2. The designers would talk about how the challenge is not to pass the ball once, but 15 times in order to create space for a shot.” Just as Konami had honed its product to near-perfection late in the PS2 lifecycle, EA Sports used the momentum of FIFA 09 to create games that pushed the outer limits of what was possible on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Starting around 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, EA began to unlock its vision of 360-degree player dribbling and passing control, eventually culminating in full freedom of movement that was desperately needed in football video games. PES would gain similar capabilities soon after, but it’s inconsistency from year to year during this period meant it could not offset the gains made by its rivals across the board. “Each game didn't just simply get better than the previous one, we'd have one game that would come along, and it would be, you know, somewhat, not industry changing, but it would be very, very influential, and it will be critically revered,” Anthony said. “And then the very next game would regress in so many ways.” To worsen matters for Konami, its inability to tap into the exploding cultural genre of YouTube and game streaming meant a disproportionate number of influencers were giving massive amounts of free publicity to FIFA. Videos of Ultimate Team pack openings that included live reactions garnered millions of views for accounts such as KSI, who now has more than 23 million YouTube subscribers having since branched into more mainstream cultural subject matter. In the years since, EA has made it a point to partner not only with YouTube stars but also with musicians and internationally famous athletes of other sports to help promote games. ”That [influencer culture] has obviously driven popularity to the maximum, to the point where now in FIFA 22, influencers and football stars were prioritised in the run-up to the game,” Oloman said. “That influencer boom, YouTube boom, all kind of came around at the same time and a lot of influencers that are now more lifestyle brands like KSI and have music albums … but they rode up on this big wave of FIFA Ultimate Team.” It was enough of a perfect storm for EA that the next-gen transition in 2013 from the PS3 and Xbox 360 to the PS4 and Xbox One came and went without significant inroads from Konami. The gap in sales in 2009 was just 1.8 million copies; by 2018 it was more than 12 million. In retreat for more than a decade and having failed to capitalise on the previous console transition, eFootball 2022 on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S marked an opportunity for Konami to use a console transition to fuel the start of a comeback. After all, EA has itself been accused of over-reliance on the Ultimate Team formula that brought popularity and profits in abundance when it first emerged. Aspects of the pack opening system, Oloman said, are predatory, with users drawn to loot boxes with low chances of acquiring desirable cards. An EA official disputed that notion, however, telling GOAL: “Spending is entirely optional in our game. Players can open FUT packs by earning rewards through gameplay and that’s how most choose to do it - more than three quarters of FIFA 21 players didn't spend in game, and nine out of 10 FUT packs opened in FIFA 21 were earned rather than purchased. “Ultimately, it is a game of skill and we spend tremendous amounts of time and resources to ensure that long-term success in-game is determined by gameplay.  “We wholeheartedly believe that Ultimate Team and FUT Packs, which have been part of the game for more than a decade, are a part of FIFA that players love and we will continue to listen to our community and invest in the game to make it better for everyone.” Not only has Konami not created a viable alternative to EA’s model this year, pouncing on the criticism levied on its counterpart, but its springtime game update pending, the company has fallen further behind amid a period that has historically been of vital importance. As Konami starts the latest next-gen cycle wrong-footed, EA Sports intends to capitalise with a fast-moving business approach. “When we kind of interact with our hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe,” CEO Andrew Wilson said on a recent earnings call. “They want more [experiences] inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11-on-11 football. They want more digital experiences outside the game, esports, NFTs, broader sports consumption and they want us to move really, really quickly.” It remains to be seen, of course, whether that promise to continue improving the product rather than becoming complacent will actually come true. And while EA Sports has for all of its criticism been the more revolutionary company since the PlayStation 3 came out, Konami has had its brilliant moments as well, albeit mostly longer ago than its rival. A return to top form from Konami, as unlikely as it might seem right now in the wake of eFootball 22, would hardly be met by silence. Take Dylan Yo, for example, a self-described football gaming fanatic with an affinity for retro titles born from a childhood spent with Nintendo World Cup, two controllers and his brother, who in adulthood still gives crooked thumbs ups to reference the mangled way his hand would look after long basement sessions pressing the sprint trigger. The New Mexico, United States, native has long been a member of the FIFA clan and currently sees little reason to leave. But that doesn’t mean he wouldn’t. Football video games, after all, can transcend the strict tribalism of the sport they simulate. “Honestly, I'd be willing to one day make the switch [to PES],” he said. “I mean, I'm not honorbound. If there's a better game that comes out, and it's soccer related, I’d try to play it because I'm more about having fun. You know, my days of super competitiveness are over. I just want to have a good time.” For many, the co-existence of FIFA and a Konami title, be it PES or eFootball, creates a competitive marketplace that can only make things more enjoyable for the consumer. After all, the duel between studios has at times bred innovation that has influenced all sports games. “They are both essential to each other, even though many people now would probably consider there isn't really a rivalry anymore,” Anthony, the documentary creator, said. “I still think it's important for them to both exist, I wouldn't want to see either of them go out of business, even though Konami has suffered really badly with the disastrous launch of eFootball. There’s still time for them to turn around and come back into this..” “A harsh lesson has to be learned from the people who made the decision to release the game in the state that it did. … The humiliation was needed.”",Football,Match,False,6107,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltf79389abc4e74ea6/0527b1141fdc461ebefc02070fd33cb368245f32.jpg
Ukrainian Premier League teams will go 'underground' in event of alarm with 2022-23 season to begin amid Russian war,"WHAT HAPPENED? Professional leagues shut down back in February following a military invasion by Russia, with no competitive action taken in since mid-December.

"'Liverpool are a pain in the a**' - Reds can still stop Man City dominance this season, says Guardiola","Liverpool can still stop Manchester City from dominating on all fronts this season, says Pep Guardiola, who has described his team's Premier League rivals as a ""pain in the a**"". City are looking good for silverware in multiple competitions once again this season - they have a nine-point lead over nearest rivals Liverpool in the Premier League, and are on the verge of the Champions League quarter-finals after thumping Sporting CP 5-0 away in the first leg of their round of 16 tie. However, City boss Guardiola is taking nothing for granted - especially when it comes to the Reds. When asked after the win in Lisbon on Tuesday night who can stop his team this season, Guardiola said: ""Liverpool. They are our biggest rivals in the last few seasons, they are always there. ""They are a pain in the a** all the time. They are a fantastic team."" It will take quite something for Liverpool to deny City the Premier League title, with the Reds trailing the leaders by nine points, albeit with a game in hand. The teams are currently scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium on April 9, but Jurgen Klopp's team are relying on Guardiola's men dropping points elsewhere to keep the title race alive. The Champions League could be another matter, with City still chasing an elusive European crown after losing to Chelsea in an all-English final last season. They might meet 2019 winners Liverpool in the last eight, should the Reds beat Inter in their own round of 16 two-legged clash.",Football,Match,False,25937,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltfc470bec3bc22d14/Timnas%20Indonesia.jpg
Chelsea boss Tuchel admits 'mixed feeling' about Carabao Cup amid Ukraine crisis,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel admits that events in Ukraine are weighing on his conscience as he attempts to prepare for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Liverpool.  The game will be the Blues' first outing since Russia invaded Ukraine this past week to set off a global crisis that has led to emotional statements around the football world. On Saturday, moreover, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who is Russian, signalled his intention to step back from operations and hand over stewardship of the club to trustees.  “Clearly [the match will act as a distraction], but still, because the war is so close, so fresh, maybe it comes with a little bit of a bad conscience on Sunday,” Tuchel signalled to reporters in the build-up to the game.  “Like, are we allowed to fully engage, fully celebrate? Or would it be inappropriate? This is how I feel about it because it’s so new and fresh. It’s a mixed feeling I have to say.” Tuchel also rejected the notion that the club could use any critical voices towards it as extra motivation for Sunday's decider.  “I know what you mean and sometimes we use these things, like when a decision goes against you or you feel treated unfairly, to build this sort of mentality to protect you, your team, your staff and build a strong crew to shield yourself from the influences and unfairness from outside,"" he added. “In this case, the issue is too big.  ""I see the point but if you give it a second thought, how does it help now if we lose a football match given the situation that we have a war? This is simply not important enough and it will unfortunately not help. If it would, I am happy to lose the match.""",Football,Match,False,19051,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt510592f55ffce056/bb9355e8918a86a05e4d58b58580162d78edd066.jpeg?width=1400&upscale=true
Van Dijk: Firmino showed he's world class in stunning Bournemouth display,"WHAT HAPPENED? Firmino was on fire this weekend, registering two goals and three assists to help his side thrash the lowly Cherries. Van Dijk also got on the scoresheet, as did Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Fabio Carvalho.

Champions League final 2021-22: Why venue has changed after Russia invasion of Ukraine & where UEFA showpiece will be played instead,"What does the Russian invasion of Ukraine mean for the 2021-22 Champions League final? Well, it will no longer be staged in Saint Petersburg as UEFA has announced a change in venue to Stade de France in Paris. The last time Russia staged the European showpiece was back in 2008, when Manchester United lifted the trophy following a penalty shootout victory at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.  The transcontinental country was given hosting rights again for this season's final, but political tension which has resulted in military action has changed the landscape. GOAL is here to bring you everything you need to know. The 2021-22 Champions League final was originally set to be staged at the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg, which is the home ground of Russian giants Zenit. However, that situation has changed following an annoucement from UEFA on February 25 and the game will now be held at Stade de France in Paris. UEFA have decided to relocate the final of the 2021/22 UEFA Men’s Champions League from Russia to France. The Stade de France will now host the final. pic.twitter.com/FtDesDaYAR The 2022 Champions League final is scheduled to take place on May 28, 2022. It was suggested that Russia may not be allowed to stage the Champions League final from the moment that president Vladimir Putin gave the green light for an invasion of Ukraine. According to U.S estimates, Russia had stationed 150,000 troops along Ukraine's borders over the last few months. The situation escalated on February 22 as Putin announced the recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states and moved soldiers into the two rebel-held regions. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced the following morning that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had begun. ""We are waking up to a very dark day in Europe,"" Javid said on Sky News. ""We’ve seen that he’s [Putin] recognised these breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and we can already tell he’s sent in tanks and troops, so I think from that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun.” The British media reported that Russia would have no choice but to give up the Champions League final as the situation continues to develop, but St Petersburg local organising committee chief Alexey Sorokin initially insisted that the game would go ahead as planned. “We do not pay attention to various comments from the British media,” Sorokin told TASS.  “We’ve been dealing with this for the last 15 years – since 2008, when something was supposedly going to be taken from us,” the official added, referring to when Russia held the Champions League final in Moscow in 2008. “UEFA is a large international sports organisation, it operates outside a political context. The organising committee and UEFA haven’t had any discussions on this topic and can’t have any. “We’re preparing for the final as planned. We’re awaiting the arrival of more than 50,000 foreign fans.” Schalke have decided to remove their shirt sponsors Gazprom following the events taking place in Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/D0PSUTvLOg UEFA held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the situation, with a statement from European football's governing body reading: ""The UEFA Executive Committee today held an extraordinary meeting following the grave escalation of the security situation in Europe. ""The UEFA Executive Committee decided to relocate the final of the 2021/22 UEFA Men’s Champions League from Saint Petersburg to Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The game will be played as initially scheduled on Saturday 28 May at 21:00 CET. ""UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis. Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement. ""At today’s meeting, the UEFA Executive Committee also decided that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams competing in UEFA competitions will be required to play their home matches at neutral venues until further notice. ""The UEFA Executive Committee further determined to remain on standby to convene further extraordinary meetings, on a regular ongoing basis where required, to reassess the legal and factual situation as it evolves and adopt further decisions as necessary."" UEFA shares the international community’s significant concern for the security situation developing in Europe and strongly condemns the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine.Full statement: ⬇️ Elsewhere, The UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, had called for UEFA to act in light of Putin's latest move. DCMS select committee chairman, Julian Knight, told the Telegraph: ""It’s something that must be considered given this naked act of aggression. ""To host such a landmark event as the Russian tanks roll sends out all the wrong messages."" When asked on British radio station LBC if the Champions League final should go ahead in St Petersburg, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replied: ""No."" She added: ""If I was on an English team [that reached the Champions League final], I would boycott it. I would, personally, not want to be playing in a football match in St Petersburg given what Putin is doing."" 'If I was on an English team, I would boycott it!'Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says if an English team makes it to the Champions League final in St Petersburg they should boycott the match.@NickFerrariLBC pic.twitter.com/sfq21y43M0 European lawmakers asked UEFA not only to strip Russia of the final, but also to sever ties with Russian state energy company Gazprom, which sponsors the Champions League. A letter to UEFA from EU politicians reads: “We call on you to stop considering Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities as venues for international football competitions and to choose as a first and very urgent step an alternative venue for the Champions League final on May 28, 2022. “In addition, we appeal to you to convene a special meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee, to terminate cooperation with Gazprom as UEFA sponsor and to consider sanctions against individual Russian officials who are complicit in the violation of international law.” Portugal was used as a host nation in 2020 and 2021 due to public health difficulties arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. UEFA relocated the 2021 Champions League final to Estadio do Dragao in Porto, while the 2020 final was held in Estadio da Luz, Lisbon. Wembley in London and Villa Park in Birmingham were suggested as alternative venues for the 2021 Champions League final when two English teams contested the trophy and there are plenty of other stadiums capable of hosting such an event. Wembley did not come into consideration this time around as, on the May 28 date, English Football League play-off finals will be taking place around the same time. Paris has been given the nod as a result, with Stade de France set to stage a Champions League final for the first time since 2006 - when Barcelona edged out Arsenal 2-1.",Football,Match,False,30436,https://image.idntimes.com/post/20201002/lionel-messi-lebron-james-kxffidw6vwgo1iknzm8fyc2w4-7660a9e39f6a8fd490464c727ff2bb79.jpg
"Senegal vs Egypt: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Senegal hope to improve on their last appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations by taking the trophy home with a win against Egypt in Sunday's final. Senegal have never won the Afcon as they were beaten by Algeria in the 2019 final and are coming up against the tournament's most successful team. Egypt have seven titles to their name and, while they have not won it since 2010, they did finish second in 2017. The last time these sides met was in 2014, with Senegal winning the last two matches between them.  They have not lost a single match at this year's Afcon and are 11/10 (2.10) favourites with bet365 to get the win here, too.  Egypt, meanwhile, are available at 10/3 (4.33) to win the match and the draw is priced at 19/10 (2.90). Senegal hero Sadio Mane is the shortest odds to score the first goal at 7/2 (4.5), while Miame Thiam is 11/2 (6.5).  Mohamed Salah is also priced at 11/2 (6.5) to break the deadlock in Egypt's favour. Senegal have hit top form in the knockout stages of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, beating each of Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea and Burkina Faso by two goals. Senegal can field their strongest XI for the final as they do not have any players missing through injury or suspension. While Egypt have won every game since their opening match defeat to Nigeria, they have had to grind out results by being strong defensively and excellent in penalty shootouts. Goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy is still struggling with an injury, meaning Mohamed Abou Gabal will likely be given the nod to start the final. Ahmed Agazy is still a doubt for the seven-time champions, so Mahmoud Hamdi El Wensh could keep his place in defence. We could be in for a tight and nervy final as Egypt will be as tough to beat as always, so backing under 2.5 goals at 4/11 (1.36) may be a good bet despite the short odds.

'Back to the origins!' - Pique explains Barcelona's vibrant win over Napoli,"Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has explained the team's 4-2 Europa League win over Napoli on Thursday as going ""back to the origins"" of what makes the club great. Specifically, he has hailed Xavi's possession-based tactics as being influential in their success. Pique was one of four different goalscorers in the match as Barcelona advanced to the last 16 with a 5-3 aggregate edge. ""We went back to the origins, to have the ball,"" Pique told reporters when asked what led to the Spanish giants' triumph at Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. ""For a while we stopped doing it. Who was to blame? A little bit of everyone, it's not fair to target anyone. Decisions were made that were not appropriate. ""Many things have changed since Bayern. Now there is a base in which the team feels confident. We have reinforced very well in January, now we have real weapons up front. ""All that is happening is a continuous improvement in the game, which sometimes translates into good results and sometimes not, but the line is ascending. I'm convinced that this trend will take us to a good position and we will see in the Europa League."" Xavi has implemented the kind of possession-orientated tactics he once used as a player at Barcelona, and on Thursday, his side held 56 per cent of the ball against Napoli. The slick, fast-paced approach is more pronounced than it was under the watch of Ronald Koeman, who was sacked earlier in the campaign. Beyond tactics, Xavi and left-back Jordi Alba have hailed the courage in the team and said their fighting spirit has helped achieve positive results. Still, it's been a difficult season for the Blaugrana as they're in fourth place in La Liga and not competing in the Champions League.

Queiroz fumes at Afcon referees after Salah's Egypt book final date with Mane's Senegal,"Egypt head coach Carlos Queiroz slammed Afcon officials after receiving a red card during his side's semi-final win over Cameroon. Host nation Cameroon were sent crashing out of the tournament on Thursday night after losing on penalties to Egypt following a goalless 120 minutes of action. One of the biggest talking points of the game came when Queiroz was sent to the stands after remonstrating with head referee Bakary Gassama late in the second half of normal time, and he vented his fury to reporters post-match. ""Again, unfortunately, they send this type of referees to a game of this level, referees with no experience, no level, wanting to put on a show... It started right in the dressing room,"" said the Portuguese manager. ""We hadn't started the game yet and he comes to the locker room to intimidate our staff. But even against this, against all the decisions, which were always against Egypt, we were the best team in the second half and on penalties."" Queiroz added on the overall treatment of his squad from officials and organisers throughout the tournament: ""CAF doesn't respect Egypt, from the timings to the quality of the pitches - we had the worst pitches! We are Egypt!  ""How can this referee, after what he has done in the past, be in the African Cup of Nations? Who understands this? Nobody!"" Queiroz's assistant Diaa Al-Sayed also stoked up controversy after the game by calling for Afcon chiefs to push Egypt's final date with Senegal back to Monday. Egypt also needed extra time and penalties to beat the Ivory Cost in the last eight and went to extra time against Morroco in the round of 16. Al-Sayed feels Egypt deserve more time to rest for the showpiece event, which is currently scheduled for Sunday and will see Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah face off against each other.  ""I want to state to all CAF authorities that Senegal have one extra day to train and therefore maybe we should play the final on Monday,"" he told the media.",Football,Rumor,False,11476,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/getty-1863299406/crop/MM5DENJWGA5DCNBUGA5G433XMU5DCNJXHIYTGMQ=/GettyImages-1863299406.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Eto’o: Fifa reminisces about Cameroon legend’s record-breaking Afcon brace,"Fifa has paid tribute to Samuel Eto’o for his record-breaking Africa Cup of Nations goal. Exactly 14 years ago at the Tamale Stadium in Ghana, the four-time African Player of the Year found the net twice as Cameroon subdued Sudan 3-0 in their last group game. #OnThisDay on 30 January 2008, @SamuelEtoo 🇨🇲 scored twice against Sudan to break the record as all-time leading scorer at the AFCON.#TeamCameroon pic.twitter.com/auCorHfXLf “On this day on 30 January 2008, Samuel Eto’o scored twice against Sudan to break the record as all-time leading scorer at the Afcon,” tweeted Fifa. Needing a win against the Falcons of Jediane to advance, Eto’o put the Indomitable Lions ahead from the penalty spot before completing his brace in the 90th minute. That feat saw him eclipse Laurent Pokou’s 14-goal mark in the biennial African football showpiece to become the highest goal scorer in the competition’s history. Cameroon reached the final of the competition, but lost 1-0 to Egypt with Mohamed Aboutrika’s 76th-minute effort deciding the game at the Ohene Djan Stadium in Accra. Eto’o consolation was winning the Golden Boot prize after scoring five goals, although surprisingly he was not named among the tournament’s best XI. At Angola 2010, the striker scored twice to take his tally in the tournament to 18 goals from six tournament appearances – a record which stands to date. Eto’o retired from football at the age of 38 since making his senior debut in 1997, scoring more than 350 goals across his club career, winning the Champions League twice with Barcelona and once with Inter Milan. With two Afcon diadems and an Olympic gold medal to his name, he is an undisputed icon of African football and retired with 56 goals in 118 games for his country. After spending his youth at the Kadje Sports Academy in Cameroon, Eto’o was signed by Real Madrid as a youngster but only made three league appearances for the club’s first team.  Following a successful loan spell in 2000, he signed for Mallorca, where a record of 54 goals in 133 league games earned him a move to Barcelona in the summer of 2004.  He shone immediately for the Catalan giants, scoring 25 league goals in his first season and 26 in his second as Barca won back-to-back Spanish titles – their first of the new millennium. His brilliance saw him come third in the 2005 Fifa World Player of the Year award, behind Brazil’s Ronaldinho and England's Frank Lampard.  In 2021, the African football icon saw off interim boss Seidou Mbombo Njoya to become president of the Cameroonian Football Federation (Fecafoot). ",Football,Match,False,41512,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSTefcSW8VT-hXvSd3qKdvKj5aeq7INsbeo2g&s
"'As a Parisian Liverpool fan, it breaks my heart' - Inside the horror of the Champions League final","For Camelia Abdennbi-Bohills, Saturday was supposed to be one of the proudest days of her life. As a French Liverpool supporter, born and raised in Paris, the idea of her club playing a Champions League final in her home city was one she had dreamed of for yours. Four days on, though, she and her fellow Reds are still coming to terms with just how badly things went wrong at the Stade de France. The fallout continues. UEFA has already commissioned an independent investigation into events, more than 5000 Liverpool fans have submitted online forms detailing their experiences, while Reds chairman Tom Werner has written to Gerald Darmanin, the French interior minister, demanding an apology for what he described as “irresponsible, unprofessional and wholly disrespectful” comments made about supporters in the aftermath of Saturday’s game. Both Darmanin and Amelie Oudea-Castera, the French sports minister, stated on Monday that the chaos outside the Stade de France, in which fans were crushed in queues outside entrances and then attacked with tear gas and pepper spray by police, had been the result of a large-scale ticket fraud.  Darmanin even suggested that as many as 40,000 supporters had arrived with “fake tickets or no tickets”, a claim that was swiftly debunked by Stade de France officials, who confirmed to AFP that less than 3,000 fake tickets had been scanned ahead of the game. Both Darmanin and Oudea-Castera were due to appear before the French senate on Wednesday afternoon, where they would be questioned on events before, during and after the final – and, in particular, the breakdown in policing and stewarding outside the stadium. Our CEO Billy Hogan has tonight provided a further update on the club’s response to the issues experienced by fans at the Champions League final in Paris. For Abdennbi-Bohills, the feeling is one of sadness, as well as anger. She is a member of the French branch of the Official Liverpool Supporters Club, and was caught up in the chaos outside the Stade de France. She had a panic attack while queuing for more than two hours to enter the stadium, and says only the kindness and support of fellow Liverpool fans got her through the experience. “I’ve never had a panic attack before in my life,” she tells GOAL. “But I know from experience what policing of football supporters is like in France. They are aggressive, and things can often escalate when they don’t need to. “I’m a mum, I have a three-year-old, and the longer it went on outside the ground, the more tense and scared I became. “The people around us were incredible. They were so kind. There was a young woman and her mum and she was amazing, they kept asking if I was OK. They calmed me down and looked after me. “Honestly, had the crowd reacted in a different manner, I dread to think what could have happened.” Abdennbi-Bohills’ mother lives around a kilometre away from the Stade de France, while she herself went to school at Cours de Vincennes, where Liverpool’s fanpark was based last Saturday.  She has attended several fixtures at Stade de France in the past, including Six Nations rugby matches and Euro 2016 games. Those, she says, were a world removed from last Saturday, when it came to policing, stewarding and the general treatment of spectators.  “What is it they say; the one who is lying is the one who changes their story?“First it was late arrivals, then it was fake tickets. I’m just surprised they didn’t use drunkenness as an excuse, for the full house.”#LFC #UCLfinal https://t.co/rlpAmIDg4a “There is definitely an attitude of aggression towards English fans, I can say that for sure,” she says. “Even if you take rugby, if it is Irish or Scottish or Welsh fans, it’s different.  “I attended Ireland against Sweden at Euro 2016, and it was a different attitude. Friendlier, calmer. “But it’s a bigger problem than [just] the attitude towards English fans, in my opinion. ""It’s a matter of how they police games generally, and anyone who attends games in France will say that I’m sure. It has gotten worse in the last four or five years too. “Fans are viewed as thugs who are going to create problems. And if you go with that attitude, then it is more likely that problems will arise. “I heard someone say on French TV that it was as if they were policing English fans from 40 years ago, and that is how it was. ""I consider myself one of the lucky ones, but a lot of fans are traumatised by what they experienced and, as a Parisien, that breaks my heart.” She adds: “It hurts, because it was a big celebration for us. On Friday, we hosted a party with The Anfield Wrap and the LFC Red Indians, and it was fantastic.  “The fanpark on Saturday was incredible. It was amazing to see Liverpool fans all over my home town. ""Then, to see and hear that they then had such an awful experience, that Hillsborough survivors have had memories triggered and all these things, it is devastating.  “Liverpool is my club, France is my country, and it hurts me to think that my country wasn’t able to host them and to make them feel safe. ""To hear people saying they never want to come to Paris again, it’s just not right.” To the Liverpool fans in Paris, what happened to you was disgraceful. You deserve so much better and now answers must follow. Hope you all got home safe ❤️ pic.twitter.com/ix24OzEBi2 Abdennbi-Bohills, at least, says she has been heartened to see widespread condemnation of the authorities, and of UEFA, in the French media, where the likes of Darmanin and Oudea-Castera have been heavily criticised and where first-hand accounts from supporters have rightly been given prominence. “The media have been condemning,” she says. “To add some context, there are parliamentary elections coming up, so people are always going to be keen to go against the government and push their own agenda, but generally there has been a lot of support and sympathy for supporters. “With that [Darmanin/Oudea-Castera] press conference, I think anyone could see ‘This isn’t right.' Once you look into the details, it’s obvious.  “Some people will believe them, which is sad, but from the people I know, the reaction was disgust. They wanted to change the narrative.  “It’s from the Hillsborough playbook of how to spread the lie. We’ve seen it before, and it’s disgusting. “Our chairman, Rodo, has been on a few important TV shows talking about what happened. I myself was on TV5 and Monde, just to give my account of things.  “It’s important to make sure fans have a voice in the French media. The message is coming stronger towards the Liverpool fans, that it was bad organisation and policing, not fake tickets and fans arriving late.” She adds: “I just hope that one day the people will come back to Paris and see us. They will always be welcome. “It’s just heartbreaking to know that so many good people had their experience in my city ruined. It’s not right, and I just wish the French government would apologise and accept responsibility.  “But sadly they don’t, and they won’t, because politics will come into play.”",Football,Analysis,False,32784,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltc5a26fe7c6b49be9/crop/MM5DCNRZGY5DSNJUHJXG653FHIYTGNR2GM======/Charlie_Morgan_HD.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Scholes brands Man Utd a 'poisonous mess' & urges them to sign Conte from Tottenham,"Paul Scholes has branded Manchester United a ""poisonous mess"" while urging his former club to try and steal Antonio Conte away from Tottenham in the summer. United have endured a miserable 2021-22 campaign so far, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer paying for the team's poor start with his job and his interim replacement Ralf Rangnick also failing to get the best out of an enigmatic group. The Red Devils are now in real danger of finishing outside of the top four and extending their trophyless run to five seasons, and Scholes cannot envisage the situation improving any time soon. The former United midfielder, who made over 700 appearances for the club between 1993 and 2013, has said on the Webby and O’Neill YouTube channel: ""The club just feels like it’s in a mess, player, staff and manager wise. ""Who wants to come into this club? It feels like a right mess. It does feel poisonous.” Scholes added on the lack of quality in Rangnick's ranks: ""It has to come a point where you think, ‘Are these players good enough?' “We know [Cristiano] Ronaldo, [Paul] Pogba, [Raphael] Varane, [Nemanja] Matic have great experience and won trophies but the rest of the squad haven’t proven themselves to be good enough to win anything. “Some of these players have had a lot of games now. Marcus Rashford, he’s had a lot of games, are we ever going to see these lads reach their potential? “Are they ever going to be good enough to win trophies? [Harry] Maguire, is he good enough? [Victor] Lindelof, is he good enough? “We keep saying how good they are but they are failing to produce what is required on the pitch.” Scholes went on to question Rangnick's suitability for the top job at Old Trafford, with the former RB Leipzig and Schalke manager considered to be lacking experience at the highest level of the game. “We have gone to a man well regarded across Europe, especially by managers who speak highly of him like [Jurgen] Klopp and [Thomas] Tuchel,"" he said of the German tactician. ""But he’s not had much success as a coach. “He won promotion in Germany and a bit with Schalke but he has been asked to come and manage the biggest club in the world - it's something I just cannot get my head round. “They should have the best available out there as their manager. They haven’t got that and I find that astonishing. “We should have one of the top five managers in the world. Now, Tuchel, [Pep] Guardiola and Klopp are the top three but they are unavailable, there is no chance of getting them. But then you look at Antonio Conte."" Scholes sees Conte as the ideal man to turn United's fortunes around and thinks the Italian could be persuaded to leave Spurs at the end of the season if he is not backed in the transfer market. ""Some people say he was not suited to United but you have seen what he is doing at Tottenham with a squad that is nowhere near as good as United’s,"" he added. “He will probably challenge for the top four and United missed a trick with him. They could probably still get him from Tottenham.

"Liverpool's winners, losers and ratings as Nunez delivers but Mitrovic rattles Van Dijk","Liverpool had to come from behind twice to secure a 2-2 draw with newly-promoted Fulham in their first Premier League game of the season. Mohamed Salah’s late strike rescued Jurgen Klopp’s men at Craven Cottage, after the home side had twice led through Aleksandar Mitrovic. Darwin Nunez marked his league debut with the Reds’ first equaliser, having come off the bench early in the second half, but Liverpool were far from their usual selves all afternoon and lost the influential Thiago Alcantara to injury to make matters worse. Jordan Henderson almost won it for the visitors in stoppage time, but saw his 25-yard effort come back off the crossbar as Fulham began life in the top-flight with a deserved point.",Football,Analysis,False,46187,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltf957d5b45d99cf48/Liverpool_celebrate_2021-22.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Akanji joins Man City in £15m transfer as Premier League champions snap up Swiss defender from Borussia Dortmund,"WHAT HAPPENED? The 27-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the reigning Premier League champions through to the summer of 2027. He will add even greater depth to a star-studded squad at the Etihad Stadium that already includes centre-half options such as Ruben Dias, John Stones and Aymeric Laporte. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Akanji has spent the last four-and-a-half years in Germany, taking in 158 appearances for Dortmund. He has 41 caps for Switzerland to his name and will be another experienced option for Pep Guardiola to call upon - with it announced that he will be taking on the Blues' No.25 shirt. IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT THEY SAID: Akanji has said: ""I am delighted to be here and can’t wait to get started. City have been one of the best teams in Europe over the last few seasons. They are brilliant to watch, play an exciting brand of football and compete for trophies year in, year out, so coming here feels like the perfect next step in my career. Pep Guardiola is an exceptional manager and this is an exceptional squad of players, so this is an exciting opportunity for me. I am really looking forward to testing myself in the Premier League and I will do everything I can to help this club be successful."" THE VERDICT: GOAL's Man City correspondent, Jonathan Smith, says: ""Even Akanji admitted the move to City was 'a bit unexpected', particularly after Guardiola said that transfer business was done for the window. City have four senior centre-backs but injuries to Aymeric Laporte and Nathan Ake have stretched resources and left them with just John Stones and Ruben Dias.  ""But with such an intense pre-World Cup schedule, City clearly think it's an area where they need extra protection, particularly after last season when they almost blew the title in the final weeks of the season when they were short of cover. With the rest of the squad starting so well, the centre of defence is a position where they can afford to be overly cautious and in Akanji they have have an experienced option, for a good price who can quickly settle into the team."" WHAT NEXT FOR MAN CITY? The Blues are not expected to be too busy on deadline day, with an unbeaten start to the 2022-23 Premier League season suggesting that they are well placed to defend a domestic crown.",Football,Exclusive,False,39637,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltf732403aea138f8a/GOAL%20-%20Multiple%20Images%20-%203%20Stacked%20-%20Facebook.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Ibrahimovic: For six months I played without an ACL in my left knee,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed that he has been playing for AC Milan without an anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee for the past six months. Ibrahimovic's involvement in Milan's Serie A title-winning campaign was reduced because of recurring injury problems. The striker has now been ruled out until 2023 after having an operation to reconstruct the cruciate ligament. The 40-year-old discussed the extent of his suffering over the last six months in an Instagram post on Thursday. ""For the past six months, I played without an ACL in my left knee,"" Ibrahimovic wrote. ""Swollen knee for six months. I was only able to train with the team 10 times in the last six months. ""Took more than 20 injections in six months. Emptied the knee once a week for six months. Painkillers every day for six months. Barely slept for six months because of the pain. ""Never suffered so much on and off the pitch. I made something impossible to something possible. ""In my mind I had only one objective, to make my teammates and coach champions of Italy because I made them a promise. ""Today I have a new ACL and another trophy."" Ibrahimovic scored eight Serie A goals in 23 appearances, 11 of which he started this season. The Sweden international helped end Milan's 11-year wait for a Serie A title as they beat Sassuolo on the final day of the season. It is not clear if the attacker will return to the game after he recovers from his operation as his contract with Milan expires this summer. In March, Ibrahimovic discussed the prospect of retiring and admitted that the thought gives him a ""sense of panic"", adding: ""I will certainly keep playing for as long as possible, as long as I can get results and am not suffering. ""I want to end my career without regrets, so I have to maximise my time.""",Football,Exclusive,False,16771,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTd8e4orKC6aSptB8QbFBBlW6-MUvRCohwKaA&s
"Liverpool vs Newcastle United: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Liverpool will be aiming to extend their strong recent run when they welcome Newcastle United to Anfield for Thursday’s Premier League clash. Jurgen Klopp’s men have won each of their last seven fixtures in all competitions and go into this match four points adrift of leaders Manchester City with a game in hand. Unbeaten in 25 home games against this opposition, Liverpool are clear 1/8 (1.13) favourites with bet365 to maintain the pressure by coming out on top yet again. Newcastle have lost five and won none of their eight league away matches this season and are 18/1 (19.0) outsiders to secure a first victory at this ground since 1994. Both encounters between this duo last season resulted in draws, and you can get odds of 8/1 (9.0) on them cancelling each other out once more. Mohamed Salah is the obvious first goalscorer bet at 11/5 (3.20) after hitting the net 21 times in 22 appearances this campaign, with Sadio Mane priced at 4/1 (5.0) after a run of six games without a goal. Top scorer Callum Wilson is the visitors' 12/1 (13.0) favourite to open the scoring with a seventh league goal of the season, while Allan Saint-Maximin offers tempting value at a lengthy 25/1 (26.0). While they eventually collapsed to a 4-0 defeat against Leicester, Eddie Howe’s side went in only a goal behind at the break at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. In fact, Youri Tielemans’ penalty is the only first-half goal they have conceded in four matches since their new manager took his place on the sidelines - conceding six out of seven goals in the second period so far. They will therefore back themselves to frustrate a Reds team that have struggled for a breakthrough in the last couple of matches, grabbing a 94th-minute winner at Wolves before needing a second-half penalty to see off Aston Villa in successive 1-0 league victories. With Liverpool clearly not quite at full speed during this hectic December period, odds of 20/21 (1.95) offer decent value on Newcastle ensuring the majority of goals aren’t scored until after half-time for their fourth game in five. All odds correct at time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

FIFA rules out changes to playing time ahead of 2022 World Cup,"FIFA has denied it is considering altering its calculation of playing and stoppage times prior to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.  Widespread media reports had suggested that the governing body might make changes in order to ensure fans get to see the ball in play more often.  But if such a decision is in the pipeline, FIFA insists it will not be introduced before the finals kick off.  ""Following some reports and rumours spread today, FIFA would like to clarify that there will be no changes to the rules regarding the length of football matches for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 or any other competition,"" the organisation indicated on its official Twitter account. FIFA StatementFollowing some reports and rumours spread today, FIFA would like to clarify that there will be no changes to the rules regarding the length of football matches for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™️ or any other competition. According to a report in Corriere dello Sport, FIFA chief Gianni Infantino had been considering extending games up to 100 minutes or longer in order to force more action.  The rumoured new measures would include giving referees more power to enforce longer stoppage time, which at the current time is restricted primarily to injuries, VAR checks and other significant delays.  Studies have concluded that while a football match lasts 90 minutes, the ball spends much less time in play.  The CIES Football Observatory found that the average time in play for a Champions League match is only 60.2 per cent, while it is not uncommon for a game to be in motion for just 45 minutes, or half, of the full 90.

Ex-Man Utd & City star Tevez takes first management job at Argentine outfit Rosario Central,"Former Manchester United, West Ham, Juventus and Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez is taking his first steps into management after inheriting the reins at Argentine outfit Rosario Central. The 38-year-old announced his retirement from playing in June 2022, following the death of his father, and is now taking on a new challenge as coaching teeth are cut in his homeland. There had been some confusion as to whether Tevez had the qualification required in order to become a boss at Rosario, but a deal has been announced and he will be taking his boundless energy into the dugout. A man that earned 76 caps for Argentina in his playing days is looking forward to putting his tactical acumen to the test. Tevez has previously said of moving into management: “I am really excited about the project I am putting together with my brothers and Chapa Retegui. “I have decided to coach. “We have been working together for four or five months and we are putting together a really good, global project. I am really into this.” 📝😄 ¡Carlos Tévez es el DT de #RosarioCentral!El Apache se convirtió en el nuevo entrenador auriazul, tras firmar contrato con el Club por 12 meses. Carlos ""el Chapa"" Retegui, será integrante de su cuerpo técnico.#VamosCanalla 💪🏼🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/5APtaJjtiX A former frontman that was famed for his combative character and keen eye for goal will have taken plenty of important lessons from the managers that he worked under down the years. He started and ended his playing career on the books at Boca Juniors, with 94 goals recorded for the Argentine giants across three spells. Tevez first left his homeland in 2005 when making the short switch to Brazil at Corinthians, but headed to Europe in 2006 when making a shock transfer to West Ham. Cult hero status was earned in east London, with one memorable goal hoping to preserve the Hammers’ Premier League status, but he did enough across 12 months to attract interest from Manchester United. He played under the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, helping the Red Devils to two Premier League titles and a Champions League crown. More headlines were then made on the transfer front in 2019 when crossing Manchester to link up with United’s arch-rivals at City. Tevez hit 73 goals for the Blues through 148 appearances, claiming another Premier League title along the way and an FA Cup winners’ medal. Two years in Italy at Juventus followed, before an initial return to his roots at Boca was made. A lucrative contract offer took him to China at Shanghai Shenhua in 2017, but that move never looked like working out and he was soon back at La Bombonera. As his game time and output began to dwindle, Tevez severed ties with Boca in 2021 and had been without a club when announcing his retirement.",Football,Update,False,9547,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blte2ed77edc2929745/1db08951c23b42a04ea0f1aa4d91c19fd2c30758.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Draxler admits unhappiness at PSG: 'My situation at the club is not easy',"Julian Draxler admits he is going through a difficult period at Paris Saint-Germain because of his lack of playing time. The attacking midfielder featured for Germany as they beat Israel 2-0 last week, the first time he has played a full match since a Coupe de France clash in January. The 28-year-old has made just 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this year, having fallen down the pecking order with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Angel Di Maria ahead of him. Draxler hopes to be part of the Germany squad for the World Cup in Qatar in November, but he is aware he might need to leave PSG in order to stay in contention for a place. ""I am happy to have played 90 minutes for the first time in a long time. I am still convinced that I have the quality for this team,"" he told the official Ligue 1 website. ""My situation at the club is not easy. I lack rhythm."" He added: ""I haven't spoken to the coach [Hansi Flick] personally, but he has already told us, as a team, that he needs players who are fit, who are in the rhythm.  ""I need to play more games for the World Cup. We'll see what happens this summer."" The Germany international joined the French giants from Wolfsburg in 2017 and has made almost 200 appearances overall. He signed a new contract with the club last year, extending his commitment until 2024. However, his playing time has been dwindling since the 2019-20 season. This year he has started just eight of the 24 appearances he has made in all competitions for Mauricio Pochettino's team.",Football,Analysis,False,41176,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQgwGb0VVob_-_zu3RjxrUXRWv-6sO8RntFMw&s
'Selling Naby is not possible' - Klopp insists Keita will not leave Liverpool before transfer window closes,"Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool will not sell Naby Keita before the transfer window closes, despite reports suggesting the Guinea midfielder is unsettled at Anfield. Keita is into the final 12 months of his Reds contract, and while the club still hope to agree an extension with the 27-year-old, there have been claims in Germany that the player has become disillusioned with his situation. GOAL reported last week that Liverpool had no intention of selling, despite interest from clubs including RB Leipzig, and that stance has since been confirmed by Klopp. Speaking to reporters ahead of Liverpool’s trip to Manchester United on Monday night, Klopp said: “Selling Naby now and not replacing him? No, that is not possible.  “But it is not the plan. We are done. Players go and we don’t replace him? No.  “Naby will not go but if he would, which he will not do, there would be a replacement.” Liverpool’s start to the new Premier League season has been a difficult one, with two underwhelming draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace, a red card for new signing Darwin Nunez and an injury list which will deny Klopp the services of players such as Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konate, Joel Matip and Curtis Jones at Old Trafford. Their struggles, relatively speaking, have strengthened calls for them to dip into the transfer market, but Klopp has consistently rejected that idea, insisting that he is happy with what he has, and that the situation will ease in the coming weeks. Asked about this ahead of the United game, he repeated that assertion: “Yes [I am happy] when they are all fit, 100 percent.  “Even then we always look to strengthen but we always said that it must be the right player, and if the right player is not available then we deal with what we have rather than sign the wrong player.  “This situation did not change. Now we have more injuries and it would be cool to have another midfielder.  “There is also the situation that I am not in charge of what we spend. That is always the same, and didn’t change. You could say that is why we are here in a good understanding and a bad understanding.” He added: “I always have to accept and always did. That is it. It makes no sense to worry about something you cannot change. That is a waste of energy, a waste of positivity.  “I love this group and not because they are so good looking, no, because they are incredible characters and they showed it again on Monday. If the facts are the facts [then] accept them and go from there.”",Football,Match,False,35233,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltdac3b7c4118e9418/GettyImages-1390684983.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Chelsea-supporting billionaires Candy and Reuben to submit separate takeover bids to buy club from Abramovich,"Two Chelsea-supporting billionaires have emerged as potential buyers of the club from Roman Abramovich, with Jamie Reuben and Nick Candy preparing separate offers.  Candy is working with a group of American investors on a bid of up to £2.5 billion ($3.3bn), which is close to the Russian oligarch's asking price.  Candy would be keen to rebuild Stamford Bridge, too, with Abramovich's plans to do the same having been scrapped following the UK Government's withdrawal of his visa in 2018.  On the subject of an improved stadium, a spokesperson for Candy told the Telegraph: ""[Mr Candy is] actively exploring a number of options. ""The club deserves a world-class stadium – and Mr Candy's unique expertise and background in real estate would be a hugely valuable asset to delivering this vision."" Candy himself added that he has spoken to ""most of the parties"" about the possibility of tabling a formal bid and said ""we are looking at what the art of the possible is."" Reuben owns roughly 10 per cent of Newcastle in conjunction with several other parties, including the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, having bought the club for £300m ($400m) just last year He has been linked with a bid for Chelsea, who he grew up supporting, by business media outlet Bloomberg, but sources close to him have since played down their interest.  That's because he would likely have to forgo his stake in the Magpies if successful.  There are a host of American billionaires who have been linked with bids for Chelsea, including Chicago Cubs chairman Thomas Ricketts, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and Crystal Palace shareholder Josh Harris. As revealed first by GOAL, Saudi Media have contacted Raine Group - who are running the sale on behalf of Abramovich - about their desire to buy the club.  One disadvantage of their proposal is that ""politically sensitive parties"" have been discouraged from making an approach. Furthermore, there's the Swiss-American duo of Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly, who are negotiating their price with Abramovich's merchant bank representatives at Raine Group.  Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish billionaire, has been talking up his efforts to buy Chelsea, but he is unwilling to come close to Abramovich's asking price.  “We have reached a certain stage,"" Bayrak told Oda TV. ""Our law and finance department will start talks with theirs in London on Thursday.  ""That’s the way it is at this point. On Thursday, we will notify the Public Disclosure Platform (KAP). People are talking about it, we made some progress in the talks, and the world believes we have a 90% chance of completing the deal.  ""Abramovich thinks the same. We didn’t give that price (£2.5bn) to the British press. Our offer is under that, I’ll at least say that.” Although Abramovich remains keen to get a deal to sell Chelsea done, there are concerns that it could take some time to complete a transaction of this size.  There is thought to be a soft deadline of Wednesday, March 9 for provisional bids, with Abramovich initially targeting closing a deal by March 15. However, there are fears that time scale might be over-ambitious. The Russian oligarch is being pushed out of his ownership of Chelsea amid fears of potential sanctions from the United States, European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom.  Any sanctions would stop him from either investing in or selling Chelsea after Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed his standing within western countries. ",Football,Analysis,False,6276,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRFRFVh4-sNtxwlvGjV0uA3bIgfxxVVzeGlRA&s

Real Madrid accused of 'dangerous environment' for women's players,"Real Madrid Femenino have been accused of fostering a ""dangerous environment"" for players by outgoing forward Kosovare Asllani, who alleges the club pushes their squad members to play with injuries. The Sweden international first arrived at Las Blancas in 2019, and was their player of the season across the 2020-21 campaign. But reflecting on her time there as she prepares to depart as a free agent, she has now blasted Madrid's attitude towards their players, suggesting that they have been forced beyond their reasonable limits. ""I think there is a culture at the club which is unhealthy for players to be in,"" Asllani stated at a press conference. ""I have almost been forced to play injured. ""The management team has not listened to the medical team. It has become a very unhealthy and dangerous environment. I have done a lot for the club from the beginning and I have seen that the club has not treated players well over the years ""I think it's important for me to talk, since no-one else has. I have tried to make changes, but in the end, the environment created there is one of refusing to listen to the medical team and the players."" Previous reports had suggested that all was not well at the club, with previous coach David Aznar criticised for his training style before he was replaced by Alberto Toril last November. Asllani however felt that there was not enough of a change to sway her to remain, adding: ""It is no coincidence that I was injured there and had a setback, as you are constantly pushed to play injured. It is not a healthy environment. ""I care so much about the club, but I feel that it is in the wrong hands. I might have left last summer, but I gave it one last chance. I've been a big part of the club's history, but unfortunately it's an environment that is not healthy, and it's not just me.

Manchester City training Ukrainian refugee footballer who fled Moscow following Russian invasion,"Manchester City are helping to train a Ukrainian refugee footballer who fled Moscow following the Russian invasion of his homeland.  Andrii Kravchuk, who is a former youth team-mate of City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko, was playing for Torpedo Moscow in the Russian second tier when his homeland was invaded.  The 23-year-old has been offered the chance to train with the club’s elite development squad to maintain his form and fitness after his contract was terminated.  Kravchuk was on a pre-season training camp in Turkey when he received a call at 5am from his mother that Russia had started bombing Ukraine.  His family have remained in the capital Kyiv, with his brother fighting alongside his country’s armed forces.  He fled to Manchester and has been allowed to train with City following approval from the UK government, the Football Association and the Premier League.  The former Ukraine under-17 and under-21 international took part in his first training session at City’s Etihad Campus on Thursday.  “I am so grateful to Manchester City for giving me this chance to train with them,” he said. ""I haven’t seen Oleks for a while but he has always been helpful for me – even going back to when we were together at Shakhtar. We’ve had a chat and I’m really happy to be here with him. “The past few weeks and months have been so difficult, but to be back on the pitch means so much to me. ""There were nice people around me at the club but I was playing in a country that invaded my homeland. Leaving the club was the only decision. People in Ukraine would not understand me if I continued to play there."" Kravchuk first met the Ukraine captain when they were aged 11 and 13 at Shakhtar Donetsk’s youth academy more than a decade ago.  “While I wish the circumstances were very different, it has been good to be back with Andrii,” Zinchenko said.  “I know how much football means to him, and how it can help us during these difficult times. I would like to thank my club for giving him the opportunity to train with us.”  Zinchenko, who has been given warm support across football, has spoken about how he has struggled to comprehend the invasion and how he wishes he was able to return to his country to aid in the fight.

She also made the list in 2020 after top-scoring in Colombia's highest division to fire America de Cali to a first-ever Championship title. When she made the switch to Deportivo Cali, there was talk of it being a transfer that would pave the way to Barcelona further down the line - but the 17-year-old says that is not the case. In an exclusive interview with GOAL, Caicedo said: “I really like Paris [Saint-Germain], Barcelona. I'm a Barca fan here secretly! I think it's just waiting for the moment. ""I don't really choose a team - wherever God gives me to arrive and enjoy it, but right now I don't think like, ‘Ah, I want to get to this team’. No, I want things to happen for me and where I can take advantage of my talent. “I think that every player wants to be a professional, wants to go abroad - obviously everything is in due time. Right now, I am focused on Deportivo Cali and the national team, so when the time comes for me to go abroad, I'm going to take advantage of it no matter what team and enjoy the game, not stress. “That's what soccer is all about, it's fun and that's what I always try to do in training and in soccer matches.” Asked about the feeling of her inclusion in this year’s NXGN list, Caicedo added: ""The truth is that I am very happy. For me, all of this is very important, to see how what I have been doing bears fruit and results. ""I always try to show, I thought it was something both individual and collective, so I also take the opportunity to thank them for taking me into account and I hope to continue winning more. ""Those around me know how well I work and how hard I strive every day. It's just a way to improve, obviously. I've had a good year, just like last year, so I'm very happy and they always want me to improve, to win first, but it's about improving and growing day-by-day."" While right now Barcelona may not be the next destination of Caicedo, it is where one of her favourite players, Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, is making a real impact. Talking about the players she idolises, the top scorer in last season’s Copa Libertadores said: “The truth is that Alexia has some excellent games, good numbers, she is an excellent player and I admire her as well as Alex Morgan. “Moving onto the men's side, I really like [Lionel] Messi, Cristiano [Ronaldo], [Kylian] Mbappe, Neymar. They are players that you see from a young age and I've always wanted to be like them. “I want to continue like this to improve and to be able to ratify myself a little more and then, continue to enjoy myself.” As for how she would like people to talk about her in a few years’ time, Caicedo said: “As a happy girl, someone who has always wanted to get ahead, who enjoys soccer, who has fun, who always feels it. “I still have a long way to go. I am only 17 years old. In the national team I have not won anything yet. I do not have a historical record, so I want to improve in that: 'Linda did the best in many things and she took advantage of it’' “I am very young and I have a lot of tournaments ahead of me, so that's what I am doing. I am believing and I hope people will know me for that, for my joy, for the way I lived soccer and that's how I always want to be known everywhere.”",Football,Analysis,False,18720,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoRIsMYNtYLuChMGuxLvpSKlHP1ev-e-x7qA&s
Barcelona star Putellas in race against time for World Cup after ACL surgery,"Barcelona star Alexia Putellas has undergone a successful operation on an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The 28-year-old sustained the injury just days before the beginning of the 2022 Women's European Championship, ruling her out of contention for Spain. Now the Barcelona captain will be in a battle to ensure she can compete for the national team in next year's World Cup as it was confirmed she will be out for an extended period of time. Barcelona confirmed that the playmaker had an operation on Tuesday morning but expect her to be out of action for up to a year. A statement read: ""The FC Barcelona Medical Services are pleased to announce that Tuesday morning's operation on Alexia Putellas at Hospital de Barcelona was a success. 🚨 OFFICIAL | Alexia Putellas has successfully undergone surgery for the rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and will be out for about 10 to 12 months. 🥺💔 pic.twitter.com/8IJDH4eEh2 ""The women's team captain and world player of the year has torn cruciate ligaments in her left knee, and will be out of action for between 10 and 12 months.

The injury to the 2021 Ballon d'Or and The Best FIFA Women's Player winner came as a huge blow for Spain's Euro 2022 hopes. She is unlikely to feature for Barcelona in the 2022-23 season, but Spain's coach, team-mates and fans will be hoping her recovery goes smoothly to ensure she can be included in the World Cup squad. The tournament in Australia in New Zealand kicks off on July 20, 2023, meaning she is in a race against time to be fit enough to make the team.

West Ham's Yarmolenko says he 'couldn't even talk' after Russia's invasion of Ukraine & was going 'crazy' while on compassionate leave,"West Ham's Andriy Yarmolenko has revealed that he ""couldn't even talk"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and went ""crazy"" while on compassionate leave. Yarmolenko, who has won over 100 caps for Ukraine at international level, was granted time off by West Ham after Russian troops began occupying regions of his homeland in February. The 32-year-old's wife and children were in Ukraine at the start of the conflict but have since returned to England after fleeing via Poland, while the Hammers have welcomed a popular figure back into the fold quicker than expected. David Moyes confirmed Yarmolenko's return for a clash with Aston Villa on March 13, and he marked the occasion by scoring, sparking emotional scenes at the London Stadium. The winger was mobbed by his team-mates after finding the net again in a subsequent Europa League clash with Sevilla, and he says his club commitments have come as a welcome distraction from the events in Ukraine. Yarmolenko struggled mentally during his brief time away from West Ham, as he said on Ukrainian YouTube channel Football 1/2/3: ""David Moyes told me I could choose to train or not and that I had to do everything I could to ensure the safety of my family. ""I needed to remain professional so I returned. I was just going crazy and you need to be distracted. But even now, I don’t know what the other results are. It is just training ends and then the phone calls home. ""It is honestly scary to talk about it. We have to help each other. If we do not then no one will. ""I am sure we will not be beaten by any country. No one will ever be able to break our spirit."" Yarmolenko went on to reveal that he was consumed by guilt and worry that left him unable to focus in training after seeing his family's arrival in Ukraine coincide with the start of Russia's invasion. ""When it all started, on February 24, I arrived at training and couldn’t even talk,"" he said. ""I had tears flowing. I asked the coach to let me go home. ""I didn’t believe this could happen. I sent my family to Kyiv because my child had to have a doctor’s appointment. ""Can you imagine what I was like when it started the next morning? I just wanted to run and hit my head against a wall. What a fool I was sending my family to Kyiv and I am sitting in London."" The West Ham star added on how the rest of his family are coping amid the war in Ukraine: ""All the relatives are alive and well. My cousins help keep in touch with uncles, aunts.  ""The ones there, where there is constant shelling going on, they are in bomb shelters, hiding in basements.""",Football,Match,False,7432,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS_81IyOLUZ1PZ-anlHBow17EYnPMg-eKhczA&s
Afcon 2021: Mane counting on Senegal’s experience for final showdown,"Senegal star Sadio Mane believes their experience will help them in their quest to win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations title on Sunday. Aliou Cisse’s men advanced into the final of the biennial showpiece for the second time in a row after beating Burkina Faso 3-1 in Wednesday’s semi-final fixture. Mane’s contribution of a goal and an assist got the job done at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium after a goalless first 45 minutes. In 2019, Senegal suffered a 1-0 loss in Cairo as they narrowly lost the continental crown to Algeria but Mane, who was part of that team too, said they are charged to end the country’s long wait for their first Afcon glory. ""Experience is a good asset,"" Mane said, as per Reuters. ""I think that has always been the case since the start of this tournament. We suffered so much with a lot of Covid cases and several injuries too. ""We had a very difficult time but with our experience we kept calm until we recovered the whole group. ""We played a final last time, so we have experience and we will try to win this trophy.” Senegal were also finalists at the 2002 edition in Mali when they lost to Cameroon via a penalty shoot-out after a goalless draw. Two decades later, Mane – who has a tally of three goals and two assists in six games played so far – noted that every player in the team has contributed to the Teranga Lions’ progress in Cameroon. “There are a lot of leaders in this team because we have a lot of great players and a lot of mature players,” he added. “Everyone is making a contribution so that the team can move forward.” Senegal are getting ready to face the winner of the clash between Egypt and Cameroon in the final showdown billed for the Olembe Stadium on Sunday.",Football,Rumor,False,30823,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt9a81689c792d5059/Salah%20Gakpo%20Van%20Dijk%20Liverpool%20GFX.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
'A top 10 life moment' - Ryan Reynolds loves incredible 30-yard chip from Mullin as Wrexham reach Wembley cup final,"Hollywood star and Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds experienced a ""top 10 life moment"" when he saw his side secure a place in the FA Trophy final. The actor was stunned by an incredible lob from outside the box by Wrexham star Paul Mullin which gave the Welsh team the lead in the semi-final against Stockport on Saturday. Mullin struck twice in stoppage time in the second half to send the National League team through to the final at Wembley, and Reynolds made him go viral by sharing his opener on Twitter. Seeing this in person was a top ten life moment for me. Thank you, @Wrexham_AFC https://t.co/IlIPDwos5V Wrexham posted the video on their official Twitter account and Reynolds shared it with the caption: ""Seeing this in person was a top ten life moment for me. Thank you."" Mullin has been amazed by the reaction his goal has received since Reynolds made his post, telling BBC Radio Wales: ""With Ryan and Rob [McElhenney, fellow owner] involved with the club it's always a bit hectic around us. ""But at the weekend, that goal's gone viral and Ryan's putting it everywhere. ""My phone's not stopped doing backflips and I've had to put it on sleep mode to get some sleep. ""But it's surreal sometimes the type of attention that the Hollywood superstars bring to the club and the area, highlighting a lot of things in Wales and Wrexham. ""It's good to see and all the fans are on a high at the moment."" He added: ""He said he'd never experienced anything like it and I often say to him that football gives you every emotion and it's impossible to describe how it makes you feel. ""I think Saturday gave him the feelings that he probably hadn't experienced before in life."" Wrexham will meet National League team Bromley in the FA Trophy final at Wembley on May 22, and Reynolds says he will be there to see his side on the big stage. He told BBC Sport: ""I got in at eight this morning, seven this morning, and I'll be home by eight, 10 tonight, to New York. It's a bit of a commute but, man, was that worth it. I'll take anything, that was really exciting.""  ""Oh, I wouldn't miss [the final]. Are you kidding me?

'I can improve everything' - Haaland warns he has not reached full potential ahead of Premier League debut,"Erling Haaland is not concerned about the idea of settling into the Premier League, and feels he can improve every single aspect of his game at Manchester City.   Man City lost 3-1 to Liverpool in the 2022 Community Shield and Haaland failed to score in a performance that saw him spurn key chances, including an opportunity from a seemingly unmissable range during the defeat. The 22-year-old completed a £51.1 million move to City from Borussia Dortmund this summer and is expected to add a prolific edge to their front line, but feels he has not yet reached his full potential. Despite arriving with such a rampant scoring record having bagged 86 goals in 89 games for Dortmund, Haaland believes he can become even better. He told Sky Sports: ""I can improve everything. If you think I'm good at one thing, I can always get better."" He went further, relishing the chance to play under Pep Guardiola and insisting that improving is something he has to do. Haaland said: ""Part of the game is to get out of your comfort zone which is something I've been doing and something I like because then you develop more as a human being as well."" Haaland acknowledged the idea of a settling-in period, but is not overly vexed by the idea of a slow start. He said: ""We will see about settling in. People can take time, people can come directly into it. We have to see, but I'm not concerned."" He added: ""That's life as a footballer - you have to live with it. For me as a striker, this is something that I cannot stress about because if you think too much, you might end up doing things you don't want to do.""",Football,Match,False,31997,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQY4pcb_RveqNkDySd1T3n4OEWqasWazHvzvw&s
"Eintracht Frankfurt vs Bayern Munich: Predictions, tips, betting odds & UK TV channel","Bayern Munich are hoping for a strong start to the post-Robert Lewandowski era as they open the new season with a game against Eintracht Frankfurt. Julian Nagelsmann's team are looking to defend their Bundesliga title and make it 11 straight successful seasons in Germany. Eintracht Frankfurt, meanwhile, finished a disappointing 11th last term and can make a statement of intent with a positive display against the reigning champions. Bayern are the big favourites to claim three points with bet365 pricing them to win at 9/20 (1.45). The home team were awful at home in 2021-22 in the Bundesliga, with only Arminia Bielefeld and Greuther Furth picking up fewer points on home soil, and they can be backed at 5/1 (6.0) with the draw offered at 4/1 (5.0). Bayern's new attacker Sadio Mane is the favourite to get the game's first goal at 4/1 (5.0) while team-mate Serge Gnabry is priced at 5/1 (6.0) to strike first. Santos Borre is 9/1 (10.0) to get the opening goal, while co-star Randal Muani is available at 10/1 (11.0). Bayern have gone through many changes during the summer transfer window. Out went star striker Robert Lewandowski and in came the likes of Sadio Mane, Matthijs de Ligt, Ryan Gravenberch, Noussair Mazraoui and young striker Mathys Tel. Eintracht Frankfurt hope to enjoy a much better season than the 2021-22 campaign.  They have strengthened over the courses of the transfer window with Jens Petter Hauge, Lucas Alario, Kristijan Jakic, Hrvoje Smolcic and World Cup-winner Mario Gotze coming in.  Bayern are expected to win big in their opening game of the season and can be backed with a -1 handicap at 1/1 (2.0) while over 2.5 goals is priced at 1/3 (1.33). Odds correct at the time of writing.

Safawi Rasid on target as Malaysia hammer Cambodia,"Malaysia have sent out an early warning sign to their Group B rivals as they defeated Cambodia 3-1 to make a winning start at the 2020 AFF Suzuki Cup.

McKennie tips Pulisic to bounce back as USMNT star opens up on his own difficult moment,"Weston McKennie says that the entire U.S. men's national team is ready to support Christian Pulisic as he looks to find his form as the Juventus midfielder opened up on his own low moment earlier in qualifying. Pulisic came to USMNT camp for World Cup qualifiers amid a difficult moment at Chelsea as he battles to earn more playing time in Thomas Tuchel's attack. And McKennie, who relied on the support of his team-mates after being dismissed by the team in the fall for a rules violation, says that the group knows how to stick together and support each other during the frustrating times. Pulisic joined up with the USMNT at a tough moment as he has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge. The winger hasn't played as much as he would like and, when he has, he's been deployed either centrally or in an unfamiliar wingback role. Pulisic has struggled in each of the USMNT's first two games of the window, which has seen the team defeat El Salvador 1-0 before falling to Canada 2-0 on Sunday. ""A lot of people will say what they want, a lot of people have their own opinions and I think, as a player, you can only truly understand what another player might think or what he's going through,"" he said. ""All of us have had our ups and downs, all of us have had difficult times, and the most important thing is that we're there for each other and obviously, with the situation that he's in, maybe the amount of playing time that's involved, it's just catching his footing again and building his confidence. ""I think, in general, he is still an important piece because he's one of those types of players that might have one spark in a game, he could maybe not do anything all game, and then have one spark. He's one of the players that are very unpredictable to the opponents and I think he's just someone that adds another type of dangerous and one-on-one ability in the final third. ""Everyone's gonna have their opinions. Everyone's gonna say what they want to say, but the team here and the staff we all have his back and we all just want to put him in the best position to succeed."" McKennie went on to reflect on his lowest point as he opened up on being dismissed from USMNT camp last fall. The Juventus midfielder was sent home for violating protocol, but has since used that moment as a turning point for club and country. He has played his way into being an irreplaceable presence with Juventus while being one of the USMNT's brightest performers in the games since he was dismissed. ""I think it was just a learning lesson,"" he said. ""I think as I went back, it was just important for me to put my head down and work and Juventus definitely helped me out with that a lot. I struggled for a bit, lost my confidence and, like I said it was a learning lesson.  ""I felt like let my team down and let my country down and my family and myself, so whenever I got called back, I was just going to try and rebuild the relationships and the trust with everyone and just perform and show that I'm there for the team and  I'm there to try and win.  ""I think the best thing as a person to do is to be available. I think that was my biggest thing: just to be available and not have a situation like that again.""",Football,Analysis,False,16863,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltdea32379ed0fed3c/GettyImages-1238190211.jpg
"'It's a real achievement to spend £1 billion and be this bad!' - Man Utd played like 'U9s' in Brentford mauling, says horrified Neville","A horrified Gary Neville lambasted the Manchester United squad after their mauling at the hands of Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday. The Red Devils were simply no match for Thomas Franks's men, who completed a 4-0 rout within 40 minutes of the match thanks to goals from Josh Dasilva, Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee and Bryan Mbeumo. The result leaves United sitting at rock bottom of the table for the first time in 30 years, and a former captain was scathing in his assessment of their latest performance. Neville said it was like watching ""men against U9s"" and described their first-half showing as the worst he'd ever seen as a United supporter. ""If you thought it couldn't get any lower, it just has,"" he told SkySports. ""I'm trying to think of one thing Manchester United have done well in the first half and I can't think of one. I've been watching United for 42 years and I can't think of a moment where I've felt it was as bad as it was in that first half."" The Red Devils have now lost their last seven games on the road, with Neville adding on a miserable run: ""If you want to look for tell-tale signs that a team lacks personality and character, it's away performances, how you deal with set pieces, it's your running stats - Manchester United are miserable in all those areas."" Neville also appeared to call out the Glazer family, United's current owners, for failing to back new head coach Erik ten Hag in the transfer market. Christian Eriksen, Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia have been the only new faces at Old Trafford so far this summer, while a long-winded pursuit of Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong is still showing little sign of bearing fruit. ""Manchester United have known for eight to ten months they've needed to rebuild the squad for the summer. Ralf Rangnick [last season's interim manager] described it as open heart surgery,"" said Neville. ""To not get the players in early - the quality of players, the number of players - that Ten Hag needed is baffling and difficult to forgive. It's not a stalled market - teams have got their business done. Every club seems to have a plan and Manchester United's seems to be, 'let's just look at the Dutch league or players that have worked under Ten Hag'. ""That is not a strategy - you can't do that. That was 15 years ago. You've got to have players identified and the work's been done with the agents.  ""Yes, of course, you always try to please the manager if he has got a player he's got really good contacts with. But the one he has got good contacts with, they can't get in - Frenkie de Jong."" Pressed on the ant-Glazer protests from United supporters in the away end, Neville replied: ""The only decent thing about United is the fans and they've had enough."" The ex-United defender also questioned how the club have spent their money since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013 after seeing Brentford exploit their many weaknesses across the pitch. ""It's a real achievement to spend a billion pounds and be this bad. It doesn't take much to dismantle this Manchester United team,"" Neville said. ""It just takes a bit of organisation, a bit of fight, and you're there. If you just rough them up a little bit and get a goal, they're flaky like you wouldn't believe.""",Football,Match,False,19035,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ6Lc5LouPAgXTeGUiBb1nU0XTEDIoGYoyL7w&s
Bayern Munich's Hoeness on potential Gnabry transfer: Do you want me to shove money down his throat until he chokes?!,"Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness claims Serge Gnabry has received a ""great"" offer to extend his contract, but says the club cannot stuff him full of money until he agrees to sign. The Germany international has been linked with a move away from the Bundesliga champions as his current deal expires at the end of next season. Bayern have offered him an improved contract, but the club fear they could lose him in the near future. Hoeness believes there is little more the club can do to convince Gnabry to stay and must leave it up to the player to decide if he wants to follow the example set by Niklas Sule and David Alaba, who let their contracts expire. ""It's the same situation as with Sule. I think he has a great offer from Bayern and now has to make a decision,"" he told RTL when asked about Gnabry's situation.  ""Your media drives me crazy with these free transfer things. What do you want to do? Should you stuff the players with money until they say yes or maybe choke on it?"" GOAL reported in April that Gnabry is considering making a move away from the Bavarian side. Real Madrid and Liverpool are among the teams interested in signing the 26-year-old winger. Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn revealed that talks over a new deal have begun, but admitted that the ex-Arsenal and Hoffenheim player is in a ""process of reflection"" as he considers his options. Gnabry featured 45 times in all competitions for Bayern this season, scoring 17 times to help them win the Bundesliga and reach the last-16 of the Champions League.",Football,Match,False,28567,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltb5fc024a78a88f82/ron_goal_tot.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
USMNT prospect Slonina completes £12.3m Chelsea transfer from MLS side Chicago Fire,"Chelsea have completed the signing of Gabriel Slonina from the Chicago Fire, with the highly-rated teenager who has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence in MLS being lined up as a possible future starting goalkeeper for Premier League heavyweights. At just 18, Slonina is being acquired by the Blues as part of a long-term recruitment plan that sees them building towards success at Stamford Bridge over a number of years. Slonina will form part of that process, with his career path seemingly set to take him to the very top of the game. Chelsea will pay up to £12.3 million ($15m) to sign Slonina if all add-ons are met, with that deal representing a new record for an American goalkeeper. The youngster will be joining a number of compatriots in England once he officially joins the ranks in west London, with USMNT custodians Matt Turner, Zack Steffen and Ethan Horvath already tied to Premier League sides Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest respectively. The likes of Brenden Aaronson, Tyler Adams and Chris Richards have also completed moves to the English top-flight this summer ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Chelsea have fended off rival interest from the likes of Real Madrid and Wolves to bring in Slonina. “We’re very proud and happy to see Gaga reach this milestone moment in his career,” said Chicago Fire FC sporting director Georg Heitz in a statement. “Since joining the club, Gaga has embodied what it means to be a Chicago Fire player. In addition to his incredible talent, he is mature beyond his years, extremely hard working and a fantastic teammate.  ""Gaga is a role model to many young aspiring footballers in Chicago, and this transfer demonstrates that a player can progress to the first team from our academy before joining one of the biggest clubs in the world.”   Slonina has penned a six-year contract with the Blues, with his signing keeping one eye very much on the future. He will not link up with Chelsea until January 2023 as the deal taking him to England includes a loan agreement that will keep him in the United States for the remainder of the current MLS campaign. Gabriel Slonina has completed a permanent transfer to Chelsea! ✍️The 18-year-old joins from Chicago Fire where he will return on loan to complete their season before moving to London at the start of 2023. Slonina only made his professional debut in August 2021, becoming the youngest MLS starting goalkeeper in the process. He has been a regular ever since, allowing admiring glances to be attracted from afar. There is an opportunity for him to head to west London with another piece of history under his belt, with Slonina currently in the process of trying to set a new MLS clean sheet record. He has 10 shutouts to his name so far, with seven more required from 11 games in order to raise a bar of individual brilliance between the sticks. Chelsea have now spent over £100m ($122m) in the summer transfer window, with big-money deals already completed for Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly. There is the promise of more movement in and out before the next deadline passes, with the likes of Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Hakim Ziyech and Armando Broja being linked with moves elsewhere.

Dortmund won’t let ‘click figures’ drive Ronaldo interest as Bundesliga giants double down on transfer rumours,"Talk of Cristiano Ronaldo making a move from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund may deliver “outstanding click figures”, but Sebastian Kehl says transfer business at Signal Iduna Park will not be driven by digital numbers. A Portuguese superstar has been pushing for the exits at Old Trafford ever since the summer window opened, as he is eager to grace a Champions League stage in 2022-23 while chasing down more major honours. Various landing spots have been mooted, only to be quickly ruled out, with a five-time Ballon d’Or winner discovering that his appeal is not as strong as it once was – with Bundesliga giants the latest to rule themselves out of the running for his signature. Dortmund sporting director Kehl has told BILD TV of the rumours linking an all-time great with a switch to Germany: “Cristiano Ronaldo will not move to Borussia Dortmund. This is so.” He added: “The click figures were probably outstanding but we have done a few things over the past days to pin down this rumour.” Kehl went on to say that Ronaldo is “certainly a fantastic player, a world footballer. But if it is said that he is missing the Bundesliga then that is not our issue.” Cristiano Ronaldo made his professional football debut for Sporting CP on this day 20 years ago 🐐 pic.twitter.com/9CgK1P4ezJ The German top-flight may appeal to the iconic 37-year-old as he has never before graced it over the course of a remarkable career. He has won league titles in England, Spain and Italy with United, Real Madrid and Juventus, while also savouring five Champions League triumphs. Any move to the likes of Dortmund or Bayern Munich would offer him a shot at adding a Bundesliga crown to his distinguished role of honour, but they have no interest in doing a deal. That is leaving Ronaldo, who has seen his current employers open the 2022-23 campaign with back-to-back Premier League defeats, short on options with another transfer window set to swing shut on September 1.",Football,Exclusive,False,18926,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltad38e861d290e6e0/GettyImages-1372605594.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Ronaldo 'siuuu!' chants infuriate tennis star Medvedev as he slams 'low IQ' fans at Australian Open,"The baffling behaviour of fans at the 2022 Australian Open has angered Daniil Medvedev, with the Russian tennis star questioning the “low IQ” of supporters who impersonate Cristiano Ronaldo’s ‘Siuuuu’ celebration. Since the opening round of this year’s Grand Slam event in Melbourne, those in attendance have taken to bellowing the Portuguese superstar’s goalscoring catchphrase at every opportunity. Former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and home favourite Nick Kyrgios are among those to have spoken out against the chants, while top-ranked men's player Medvedev has called for greater respect from the stands. An 𝒊𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒊𝒄 Australian Open interview 🇦🇺Daniil Medvedev's next match in front of the Melbourne fans will be interesting...#AusOpen | @DaniilMedwed pic.twitter.com/BkTYa6N8Au Medvedev, who is favourite to claim the prize in Australia following the deportation of title holder Novak Djokovic, came through his second round match against Krygios on Thursday. He prevailed 7-6 6-4 4-6 6-2 on the court, but was quick to pick up on the crowd antics afterwards. He said: “That is the only choice when you get booed between first and second serve. You have to stay calm and win the match.” Former world No 1 Jim Courier, who was conducting the post-match interviews, said: “I know. I know. I think they are saying ‘siuuuu’ which is a soccer, football thing.” As the chant started again, a frustrated Medvedev replied: “Sorry, I can’t hear you. Show some respect for Jim Courier. Thank you, guys. Let him speak please. If you respect somebody, at least respect Jim Courier. What I was saying is... I cannot hear him, guys.” He then added: “Break point, second serve and people are cheering like you already made a double fault - that’s just disappointing. It’s not everybody who is doing it but those who are doing it probably have a low IQ.” Having taken aim at the crowd during his discussion with Courier, Medvedev was then forced to head for the locker rooms with more chants ringing in his ears. His final act before making his way backstage was to carry out the customary duty of signing a camera lens.

"Gabon sexual abuse cases: Fifa hand out suspensions, formal proceedings begin","Fifa's Independent Ethics Committee have suspended Patrick Assoumou Eyi, Serge Mombo, and two other football coaches as they begin investigations into alleged sexual abuse in Gabonese football. The individuals have been accused of raping, grooming and exploiting young players.  According to The Guardian, Eyi - who was the national U17 coach - has already admitted to committing the aforementioned crimes and is waiting to be sentenced. Mombo, who is heading Gabon's top tier, is also under investigation alongside Orphee Mickala of Tout Puissant Akwembe FC and Moussavou FC's Triphel Mabicka. Mombo allegedly sexually abused young players and demanded sex from players to secure places for them on the national team. The administrator has denied the claims. The suspects have been banned from all football-related activities for 90 days by the world football governing body. ""These sanctions have been imposed in connection with ongoing criminal investigations concerning the above-mentioned Gabonese football officials, who were identified as having allegedly been involved in acts of systematic sexual abuse against minor players, as reported by local authorities and published in certain media outlets,"" read part of the statement from Fifa. The Gabonese Football Federation President Pierre-Alain Mounguengui has also undergone pre-trial detention at the central prison in Libreville after being arrested in connection with the aforementioned crimes. Despite not being directly connected with the crimes, the 64-year-old might serve up to three years in jail if found guilty of not reporting the offenses against the minors. An initial statement from the international player's union, Fifpro, asked action to be taken to prevent sexual abuses from happening and urged the Gabon government to treat the case as 'a matter of urgency'. ""Our preliminary inquiries yielded consistent evidence from credible witnesses who all tell of an ongoing and long-embedded practice of forcing young players into sexual relationships as a pre-condition for footballing opportunities,"" Fifpro stated.  ""If these allegations are indeed true, it is yet further evidence that football is being consistently exploited, across leagues and continents, as a forum for abusers to access, groom, extort and assault players. More must be done to prevent this horrific abuse and we call on football’s governing bodies to act as a matter of urgency.""",Football,Analysis,False,25367,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRuYGzZyERl45Sa23XCvDNfF1a8JUwi0NzrHQ&s
Adem Buyuk causes stir in Turkey as Yeni Malatyaspor player-coach subs himself on - but his team still loses,"Turkish football witnessed something a little different on Saturday as Yeni Malatyaspor's new player-coach subbed himself on for the first time since being appointed. Having been promoted to the dual role following Marius Sumudica's exit earlier in February, the forward introduced himself after 55 minutes against Antalyaspor in place of Mustafa Eskihellac. Despite the bold move, Malatyaspor lost the game 2-1. With the first half of the match having ended 1-0 to Antalyaspor, Buyuk made the decision to shake things up, bringing himself onto the pitch 10 minutes after the restart in search of an equaliser. The 34-year-old put in a decent performance, putting an effort just wide of the post, but Fernando doubled the visitors' lead shortly after Buyuk was introduced, meaning Raman Cagiran's late goal was a mere consolation. Interestingly, former Liverpool, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund star Nuri Sahin, now manager of Antalyaspor, was also amongst the substitutes for the match but remained in the dugout for the duration of the game. Buyuk took charge of his first match last week against Sivasspor, but remained on the bench in what ultimately ended up another 2-1 loss.",Football,Match,False,30105,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt61b5728d3d9b6f7f/ea1499c3c2a39a86b3b7c83d1b644698cf9ec31f.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
Arsenal most expensive player sales - How Gunners made over £685m in outgoing transfers,"During the early days of Arsene Wenger, Arsenal were known for cashing in on players for big profit, but nowadays they find things far more difficult. The Gunners’ struggles to get big transfer fees has been the source of much frustration from fans, who have seen plenty of star names opt to run down their contracts and leave on a free transfer over the course of the past decade.

Van Dijk could have joined Crystal Palace for £5m - but Liverpool star was turned down for being 'too slow',"Former Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has revealed that he had the chance to sign Virgil van Dijk for just £5 million before his Southampton move - but passed up on the opportunity.  Van Dijk went on to shine at the Saints and then Liverpool, where he has blossomed into one of the world's best defenders.  But according to Warnock, concerns over the Dutchman's pace led him to turn the player down.  ""The one that got away from me was Virgil van Dijk,"" Warnock told the Mirror. ""I got offered him when I was at Crystal Palace for £5 million. ""But my chief scout said he was too slow and he ended up at Southampton instead! It’s a shame because anything he may lack in pace, he makes up for 10-fold in his ability to read the game."" Warnock also passed judgement on Gareth Southgate's England team, who are reeling after going down to an historic 4-0 home defeat to Hungary in the UEFA Nations League.  ""I don't think there was anybody better than Gareth but the problem he's got is he's had so much success,"" he added.  ""When I first started in football an experienced manager Bob Murphy told me 'the problem with success is the fans always want more'. ""Gareth needs to get a few weeks off to recharge his batteries. These results mean at the beginning of the next camp people will be apprehensive. ""I don't think you can win as England manager. I think it's a horrible job. It's impossible to please everybody. I think it's a no-win.""",Football,Analysis,False,41313,https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt406da9ffff9e6d73/GOAL%20-%20Image%20&%20Crest%20-%20Facebook%20(90).png?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=3840&quality=60
